#' Predictive modeling benchmark
#'
#' @description
#' Objects prefixed with `modeling_` correspond to the predictive modeling
#' benchmark in dseval.
#'
#' * `modeling_dataset` is the dataset underlying the eval.
#' * `modeling_solver` is the solver, which just prompts the provided chat with the
#' instruction and working directory provided in `modeling_dataset$input` and
#' allows the model to "converse" with a mock analystâ€”an LLM instance that
#' just gently prods the model along without providing any specific guidance.
#' * The scorer for the predictive modeling task is inspired by the original
#'   benchmark's "Relative Performance Gap" metric. The best analysis set
#'   error metric found by the model is compared to the best test set error
#'   metric from the Kaggle competition.
#' * `modeling_task` combines the dataset, solver, and scorer, as well as a
#'   measurement Mean(Relative Performance Gap), into a [vitals::Task].

# scorer -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#' @section Scoring:
#' LLM agents are scored on their ability to build predictive models and store
#' the modeling results in persistent files.
#'
#' The modeling results are benchmarked using the "Relative Performance Gap"
#' introduced in the original paper. The best error metric achieved by the
#' model is juxtaposed with 1) a baseline metric, generated using no predictors
#' and 2), the best metric achieved on Kaggle.
#'
#' For a given modeling problem, 0 means observed performance equals baseline
#' (no improvement), and 1 means the observed performance is equal to the
#' best performance on Kaggle (optimal). Values greater than 1 mean that the
#' solver did better than the best Kaggle submission, and are more likely to
#' indicate an issue with the eval than actual improvement on the best Kaggle
#' submission. NA means the model failed to successfully present a
#' submission.
#'
#' When summing across all modeling problems, NAs are treated as zeroes, and the
#' mean is taken and then multiplied by 100. So, a score of 100 means
#' "on average across modeling competitions, as good as the winning
#' Kaggle submissions."
