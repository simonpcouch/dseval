This repository implements an adaptation of
[DSBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07703), a data science LLM
evaluation, in R using [vitals](https://vitals.tidyverse.org/).

The original benchmark contains 466 data analysis questions:

- In DSBench, each question has a multiple choice answer. This is an
  issue: very seldomly in real life do data science tasks end with a
  multiple choice answer. Also, this increases the risk of sandbagging,
  where models will realize they’re being evaluated and their behavior
  might change as a result. DSEval rephrases questions to have
  open-ended answers.
- In DSBench, the .xslx, .csv, and other source files are inlined into
  the user prompt. In DSEval, models are situated in a working directory
  where those files exist.
- File names and references are renamed to be less indicative of
  competition data science / model evaluations, also to descrease the
  risk of sandbagging.
- Rather than requiring the agent to complete the task in one fell
  swoop, the agent is allowed to ask a user questions. That “user” is
  actually a “model-in-the-middle”, instructed to generally provide a
  thumbs-up and little guidance.

> IMPORTANT
>
> This evaluation is highly experimental and much of its documentation
> is aspirational.

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne.

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne.

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne.

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne.

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne.

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne.

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne.

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne.

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne.

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month.

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month.

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 17\nWhat price should your company offer for a 20% stake in the plant in order to earn the 10%\nrequired rate of return based on the revenues calculated using the market price subject to a floor\nand a cap?

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 18\nWhat price should your company offer for a 20% stake in the plant in order to earn the 4% required\nrate of return based on the revenues calculated using the floor price only? Round your answer to\nthe nearest whole dollar.\nType in your answer, without any dollar signs or thousands separator.  E.g. $1,000,000 should be typed\nas 1000000.

Acquisitions (M&A) transaction, the ability to find and use good comparable data for a valuation is? a. Relatively easy because each successful company within an industry uses the same ratios b. Relatively easy because public stock price fluctuation is not sufficient or erratic enough to make a difference c. Relatively difficult because book value is adjusted in small companies as FIFO (first-in first-out) is the method of choice and in public companies book value is static due to LIFO (last-in-first our method) d. d. Relatively difficult because size differential, management depth product diversity and access to lines of credit will seldom match the company you are valuing

                                      DSBench/data/00000003, INTRODUCTION\nA friend has approached you asking for help estimating the winning odds on a heavily modified variation of \na popular dice game. His version of the game works as follows: \n• \nThe player rolls 3 dice, each die has 6 sides \n• \nIf the total rolled is 3,4,5,16,17 or 18 the player loses \n• \nIf the total rolled is 7 or 11 the player wins \n• \nIf any other number is rolled, the player rolls again \n• \nRerolls work the same way as the initial roll, except that if the player rolls the same number as their \nfirst roll they win. For example if the player rolls 15-13-6-15 they would win \n \nYou quickly identify this as a statistical problem but given the complexity and the fact that you slept \nthrough most of your statistics classes at university, you decide to use a Monte Carlo simulation to \nestimate the odds.  \nWhen preparing your analysis you should assume the following: \n• \nNo more than 50 rolls are required to achieve a result \n• \n5000 outcomes are required to prepare your Monte Carlo.  \n \nFor simplicity, you could use a Data Table to run your Monte Carlo.\n\nQUESTION 1 What is the probability of the player winning the game? a) <60% b) 60%-65% c) 65%-70% d) >70%

                                DSBench/data/00000003, INTRODUCTION\nA friend has approached you asking for help estimating the winning odds on a heavily modified variation of \na popular dice game. His version of the game works as follows: \n• \nThe player rolls 3 dice, each die has 6 sides \n• \nIf the total rolled is 3,4,5,16,17 or 18 the player loses \n• \nIf the total rolled is 7 or 11 the player wins \n• \nIf any other number is rolled, the player rolls again \n• \nRerolls work the same way as the initial roll, except that if the player rolls the same number as their \nfirst roll they win. For example if the player rolls 15-13-6-15 they would win \n \nYou quickly identify this as a statistical problem but given the complexity and the fact that you slept \nthrough most of your statistics classes at university, you decide to use a Monte Carlo simulation to \nestimate the odds.  \nWhen preparing your analysis you should assume the following: \n• \nNo more than 50 rolls are required to achieve a result \n• \n5000 outcomes are required to prepare your Monte Carlo.  \n \nFor simplicity, you could use a Data Table to run your Monte Carlo.\n\nQUESTION 2 What is the average number of rolls per game? a) Less than 2.7 b) 2.7 – 2.9 c) 2.9 - 3.1 d) More than 3.1

asking for help estimating the winning odds on a heavily modified variation of \na popular dice game. His version of the game works as follows: \n• \nThe player rolls 3 dice, each die has 6 sides \n• \nIf the total rolled is 3,4,5,16,17 or 18 the player loses \n• \nIf the total rolled is 7 or 11 the player wins \n• \nIf any other number is rolled, the player rolls again \n• \nRerolls work the same way as the initial roll, except that if the player rolls the same number as their \nfirst roll they win. For example if the player rolls 15-13-6-15 they would win \n \nYou quickly identify this as a statistical problem but given the complexity and the fact that you slept \nthrough most of your statistics classes at university, you decide to use a Monte Carlo simulation to \nestimate the odds.  \nWhen preparing your analysis you should assume the following: \n• \nNo more than 50 rolls are required to achieve a result \n• \n5000 outcomes are required to prepare your Monte Carlo.  \n \nFor simplicity, you could use a Data Table to run your Monte Carlo.\n\nQUESTION 3 Your friend decides to include the numbers 8 and 9 as a losing number for only the initial roll, what is the new probability of the player winning the game? a) <50% b) 50%-55% c) 55%-65% d) >65%

The authority waste is split into a guaranteed tonnage amount and an additional tonnage amount. \nIf the authority tonnage received in a given period is less than the guaranteed tonnage amount, then \nrevenue is still received for the “missing” tonnage. Tonnage which is paid for but not received in this \nmanner is written off against additional tonnage in later quarters. \nThere is a subcontractor which processes the waste and charges a fee proportional to the amount of \nwaste that is incinerated. Once processed, waste is either incinerated, recycled or landfilled. The revenue \nreceived from the recycling and the cost of landfill is passed through to the operator. \nThe flowchart on the following page describes how the total waste processed in each quarter is split into \ndifferent categories. On the flowchart, the numbers in brackets next to each waste stream indicate the cost \nand revenue types which apply to that waste stream. The different revenues and costs are described in \nthe table below. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated, they are given in 2017 prices. Depending on the terms of the contracts \nwith various parties, the inflation for each revenue or cost item steps annually or quarterly, and at the \nagreed rate for that line item. \nInflation should be applied such that a full year of inflation has been applied on or by 1 January of each \nsubsequent year (i.e. for all inflation indices the value of the index on 1 January 2019 should reflect \nexactly one year of inflation).  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations.  \nYour model should be quarterly and cover the period from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2030.  \n \n \nFor Questions 41 to 48, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 49 to 50, you are required to type in your answer.\n \nWASTE FLOW CHART\n \n*this is given in the inputs file on a quarterly basis \nSee the image for the flow chart.\n\nAPPLICABLE COSTS AND REVENUES \n\nCost or Revenue                    Cost                       Inflation                          Notes\nRev 1 (Third party waste gate fees) $50 per tonne              2.5% per annum applied annually\n\nRev 2 (Guaranteed waste gate fees)  $45 per tonne              2% per annum applied annually      If the guaranteed wasteflow in a quarter is less than 75,000 tonnes the fee must be paid as though the wasteflow were 75,000 tonnes.\n                                                                                                 In the next periods the tonnage that was overcharged is deducted from the tonnage that is subject to the additional waste gate fee (Rev 3). Overcharged tonnage is carried forward until fully written off against additional waste.\n\nRev 3 (Additional waste gate fees)  $70 per tonne              Not inflated                       See the note under Rev 2 for calculating the tonnage amount used for this revenue.\n                                                                                                 The additional waste revenue is then subject to a payment delay of one quarter.

The authority waste is split into a guaranteed tonnage amount and an additional tonnage amount. \nIf the authority tonnage received in a given period is less than the guaranteed tonnage amount, then \nrevenue is still received for the “missing” tonnage. Tonnage which is paid for but not received in this \nmanner is written off against additional tonnage in later quarters. \nThere is a subcontractor which processes the waste and charges a fee proportional to the amount of \nwaste that is incinerated. Once processed, waste is either incinerated, recycled or landfilled. The revenue \nreceived from the recycling and the cost of landfill is passed through to the operator. \nThe flowchart on the following page describes how the total waste processed in each quarter is split into \ndifferent categories. On the flowchart, the numbers in brackets next to each waste stream indicate the cost \nand revenue types which apply to that waste stream. The different revenues and costs are described in \nthe table below. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated, they are given in 2017 prices. Depending on the terms of the contracts \nwith various parties, the inflation for each revenue or cost item steps annually or quarterly, and at the \nagreed rate for that line item. \nInflation should be applied such that a full year of inflation has been applied on or by 1 January of each \nsubsequent year (i.e. for all inflation indices the value of the index on 1 January 2019 should reflect \nexactly one year of inflation).  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations.  \nYour model should be quarterly and cover the period from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2030.  \n \n \nFor Questions 41 to 48, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 49 to 50, you are required to type in your answer.\n \nWASTE FLOW CHART\n \n*this is given in the inputs file on a quarterly basis \nSee the image for the flow chart.\n\nAPPLICABLE COSTS AND REVENUES \n\nCost or Revenue                    Cost                       Inflation                          Notes\nRev 1 (Third party waste gate fees) $50 per tonne              2.5% per annum applied annually\n\nRev 2 (Guaranteed waste gate fees)  $45 per tonne              2% per annum applied annually      If the guaranteed wasteflow in a quarter is less than 75,000 tonnes the fee must be paid as though the wasteflow were 75,000 tonnes.\n                                                                                                 In the next periods the tonnage that was overcharged is deducted from the tonnage that is subject to the additional waste gate fee (Rev 3). Overcharged tonnage is carried forward until fully written off against additional waste.\n\nRev 3 (Additional waste gate fees)  $70 per tonne              Not inflated                       See the note under Rev 2 for calculating the tonnage amount used for this revenue.\n                                                                                                 The additional waste revenue is then subject to a payment delay of one quarter.

The authority waste is split into a guaranteed tonnage amount and an additional tonnage amount. \nIf the authority tonnage received in a given period is less than the guaranteed tonnage amount, then \nrevenue is still received for the “missing” tonnage. Tonnage which is paid for but not received in this \nmanner is written off against additional tonnage in later quarters. \nThere is a subcontractor which processes the waste and charges a fee proportional to the amount of \nwaste that is incinerated. Once processed, waste is either incinerated, recycled or landfilled. The revenue \nreceived from the recycling and the cost of landfill is passed through to the operator. \nThe flowchart on the following page describes how the total waste processed in each quarter is split into \ndifferent categories. On the flowchart, the numbers in brackets next to each waste stream indicate the cost \nand revenue types which apply to that waste stream. The different revenues and costs are described in \nthe table below. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated, they are given in 2017 prices. Depending on the terms of the contracts \nwith various parties, the inflation for each revenue or cost item steps annually or quarterly, and at the \nagreed rate for that line item. \nInflation should be applied such that a full year of inflation has been applied on or by 1 January of each \nsubsequent year (i.e. for all inflation indices the value of the index on 1 January 2019 should reflect \nexactly one year of inflation).  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations.  \nYour model should be quarterly and cover the period from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2030.  \n \n \nFor Questions 41 to 48, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 49 to 50, you are required to type in your answer.\n \nWASTE FLOW CHART\n \n*this is given in the inputs file on a quarterly basis \nSee the image for the flow chart.\n\nAPPLICABLE COSTS AND REVENUES \n\nCost or Revenue                    Cost                       Inflation                          Notes\nRev 1 (Third party waste gate fees) $50 per tonne              2.5% per annum applied annually\n\nRev 2 (Guaranteed waste gate fees)  $45 per tonne              2% per annum applied annually      If the guaranteed wasteflow in a quarter is less than 75,000 tonnes the fee must be paid as though the wasteflow were 75,000 tonnes.\n                                                                                                 In the next periods the tonnage that was overcharged is deducted from the tonnage that is subject to the additional waste gate fee (Rev 3).

The authority waste is split into a guaranteed tonnage amount and an additional tonnage amount. \nIf the authority tonnage received in a given period is less than the guaranteed tonnage amount, then \nrevenue is still received for the “missing” tonnage. Tonnage which is paid for but not received in this \nmanner is written off against additional tonnage in later quarters. \nThere is a subcontractor which processes the waste and charges a fee proportional to the amount of \nwaste that is incinerated. Once processed, waste is either incinerated, recycled or landfilled. The revenue \nreceived from the recycling and the cost of landfill is passed through to the operator. \nThe flowchart on the following page describes how the total waste processed in each quarter is split into \ndifferent categories. On the flowchart, the numbers in brackets next to each waste stream indicate the cost \nand revenue types which apply to that waste stream. The different revenues and costs are described in \nthe table below. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated, they are given in 2017 prices. Depending on the terms of the contracts \nwith various parties, the inflation for each revenue or cost item steps annually or quarterly, and at the \nagreed rate for that line item. \nInflation should be applied such that a full year of inflation has been applied on or by 1 January of each \nsubsequent year (i.e. for all inflation indices the value of the index on 1 January 2019 should reflect \nexactly one year of inflation).  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations.  \nYour model should be quarterly and cover the period from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2030.  \n \n \nFor Questions 41 to 48, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 49 to 50, you are required to type in your answer.\n \nWASTE FLOW CHART\n \n*this is given in the inputs file on a quarterly basis \nSee the image for the flow chart.\n\nAPPLICABLE COSTS AND REVENUES \n\nCost or Revenue                    Cost                       Inflation                          Notes\nRev 1 (Third party waste gate fees) $50 per tonne              2.5% per annum applied annually\n\nRev 2 (Guaranteed waste gate fees)  $45 per tonne              2% per annum applied annually      If the guaranteed wasteflow in a quarter is less than 75,000 tonnes the fee must be paid as though the wasteflow were 75,000 tonnes.\n                                                                                                 In the next periods the tonnage that was overcharged is deducted from the tonnage that is subject to the additional waste gate fee (Rev 3). Overcharged tonnage is carried forward until fully written off against additional waste.\n\nRev 3 (Additional waste gate fees)  $70 per tonne              Not inflated                       See the note under Rev 2 for calculating the tonnage amount used for this revenue.\n                                                                                                 The additional waste revenue is then subject to a payment delay of one quarter.

The authority waste is split into a guaranteed tonnage amount and an additional tonnage amount. \nIf the authority tonnage received in a given period is less than the guaranteed tonnage amount, then \nrevenue is still received for the “missing” tonnage. Tonnage which is paid for but not received in this \nmanner is written off against additional tonnage in later quarters. \nThere is a subcontractor which processes the waste and charges a fee proportional to the amount of \nwaste that is incinerated. Once processed, waste is either incinerated, recycled or landfilled. The revenue \nreceived from the recycling and the cost of landfill is passed through to the operator. \nThe flowchart on the following page describes how the total waste processed in each quarter is split into \ndifferent categories. On the flowchart, the numbers in brackets next to each waste stream indicate the cost \nand revenue types which apply to that waste stream. The different revenues and costs are described in \nthe table below. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated, they are given in 2017 prices. Depending on the terms of the contracts \nwith various parties, the inflation for each revenue or cost item steps annually or quarterly, and at the \nagreed rate for that line item. \nInflation should be applied such that a full year of inflation has been applied on or by 1 January of each \nsubsequent year (i.e. for all inflation indices the value of the index on 1 January 2019 should reflect \nexactly one year of inflation).  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations.  \nYour model should be quarterly and cover the period from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2030.  \n \n \nFor Questions 41 to 48, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 49 to 50, you are required to type in your answer.\n \nWASTE FLOW CHART\n \n*this is given in the inputs file on a quarterly basis \nSee the image for the flow chart.\n\nAPPLICABLE COSTS AND REVENUES \n\nCost or Revenue                    Cost                       Inflation                          Notes\nRev 1 (Third party waste gate fees) $50 per tonne              2.5% per annum applied annually\n\nRev 2 (Guaranteed waste gate fees)  $45 per tonne              2% per annum applied annually      If the guaranteed wasteflow in a quarter is less than 75,000 tonnes the fee must be paid as though the wasteflow were 75,000 tonnes.\n                                                                                                 In the next periods the tonnage that was overcharged is deducted from the tonnage that is subject to the additional waste gate fee (Rev 3).

The authority waste is split into a guaranteed tonnage amount and an additional tonnage amount. \nIf the authority tonnage received in a given period is less than the guaranteed tonnage amount, then \nrevenue is still received for the “missing” tonnage. Tonnage which is paid for but not received in this \nmanner is written off against additional tonnage in later quarters. \nThere is a subcontractor which processes the waste and charges a fee proportional to the amount of \nwaste that is incinerated. Once processed, waste is either incinerated, recycled or landfilled. The revenue \nreceived from the recycling and the cost of landfill is passed through to the operator. \nThe flowchart on the following page describes how the total waste processed in each quarter is split into \ndifferent categories. On the flowchart, the numbers in brackets next to each waste stream indicate the cost \nand revenue types which apply to that waste stream. The different revenues and costs are described in \nthe table below. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated, they are given in 2017 prices. Depending on the terms of the contracts \nwith various parties, the inflation for each revenue or cost item steps annually or quarterly, and at the \nagreed rate for that line item. \nInflation should be applied such that a full year of inflation has been applied on or by 1 January of each \nsubsequent year (i.e. for all inflation indices the value of the index on 1 January 2019 should reflect \nexactly one year of inflation).  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations.  \nYour model should be quarterly and cover the period from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2030.  \n \n \nFor Questions 41 to 48, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 49 to 50, you are required to type in your answer.\n \nWASTE FLOW CHART\n \n*this is given in the inputs file on a quarterly basis \nSee the image for the flow chart.\n\nAPPLICABLE COSTS AND REVENUES \n\nCost or Revenue                    Cost                       Inflation                          Notes\nRev 1 (Third party waste gate fees) $50 per tonne              2.5% per annum applied annually\n\nRev 2 (Guaranteed waste gate fees)  $45 per tonne              2% per annum applied annually      If the guaranteed wasteflow in a quarter is less than 75,000 tonnes the fee must be paid as though the wasteflow were 75,000 tonnes.\n                                                                                                 In the next periods the tonnage that was overcharged is deducted from the tonnage that is subject to the additional waste gate fee (Rev 3).

The authority waste is split into a guaranteed tonnage amount and an additional tonnage amount. \nIf the authority tonnage received in a given period is less than the guaranteed tonnage amount, then \nrevenue is still received for the “missing” tonnage. Tonnage which is paid for but not received in this \nmanner is written off against additional tonnage in later quarters. \nThere is a subcontractor which processes the waste and charges a fee proportional to the amount of \nwaste that is incinerated. Once processed, waste is either incinerated, recycled or landfilled. The revenue \nreceived from the recycling and the cost of landfill is passed through to the operator. \nThe flowchart on the following page describes how the total waste processed in each quarter is split into \ndifferent categories. On the flowchart, the numbers in brackets next to each waste stream indicate the cost \nand revenue types which apply to that waste stream. The different revenues and costs are described in \nthe table below. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated, they are given in 2017 prices. Depending on the terms of the contracts \nwith various parties, the inflation for each revenue or cost item steps annually or quarterly, and at the \nagreed rate for that line item. \nInflation should be applied such that a full year of inflation has been applied on or by 1 January of each \nsubsequent year (i.e. for all inflation indices the value of the index on 1 January 2019 should reflect \nexactly one year of inflation).  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations.  \nYour model should be quarterly and cover the period from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2030.  \n \n \nFor Questions 41 to 48, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 49 to 50, you are required to type in your answer.\n \nWASTE FLOW CHART\n \n*this is given in the inputs file on a quarterly basis \nSee the image for the flow chart.\n\nAPPLICABLE COSTS AND REVENUES \n\nCost or Revenue                    Cost                       Inflation                          Notes\nRev 1 (Third party waste gate fees) $50 per tonne              2.5% per annum applied annually\n\nRev 2 (Guaranteed waste gate fees)  $45 per tonne              2% per annum applied annually      If the guaranteed wasteflow in a quarter is less than 75,000 tonnes the fee must be paid as though the wasteflow were 75,000 tonnes.\n                                                                                                 In the next periods the tonnage that was overcharged is deducted from the tonnage that is subject to the additional waste gate fee (Rev 3).

The authority waste is split into a guaranteed tonnage amount and an additional tonnage amount. \nIf the authority tonnage received in a given period is less than the guaranteed tonnage amount, then \nrevenue is still received for the “missing” tonnage. Tonnage which is paid for but not received in this \nmanner is written off against additional tonnage in later quarters. \nThere is a subcontractor which processes the waste and charges a fee proportional to the amount of \nwaste that is incinerated. Once processed, waste is either incinerated, recycled or landfilled. The revenue \nreceived from the recycling and the cost of landfill is passed through to the operator. \nThe flowchart on the following page describes how the total waste processed in each quarter is split into \ndifferent categories. On the flowchart, the numbers in brackets next to each waste stream indicate the cost \nand revenue types which apply to that waste stream. The different revenues and costs are described in \nthe table below. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated, they are given in 2017 prices. Depending on the terms of the contracts \nwith various parties, the inflation for each revenue or cost item steps annually or quarterly, and at the \nagreed rate for that line item. \nInflation should be applied such that a full year of inflation has been applied on or by 1 January of each \nsubsequent year (i.e. for all inflation indices the value of the index on 1 January 2019 should reflect \nexactly one year of inflation).  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations.  \nYour model should be quarterly and cover the period from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2030.  \n \n \nFor Questions 41 to 48, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 49 to 50, you are required to type in your answer.\n \nWASTE FLOW CHART\n \n*this is given in the inputs file on a quarterly basis \nSee the image for the flow chart.\n\nAPPLICABLE COSTS AND REVENUES \n\nCost or Revenue                    Cost                       Inflation                          Notes\nRev 1 (Third party waste gate fees) $50 per tonne              2.5% per annum applied annually\n\nRev 2 (Guaranteed waste gate fees)  $45 per tonne              2% per annum applied annually      If the guaranteed wasteflow in a quarter is less than 75,000 tonnes the fee must be paid as though the wasteflow were 75,000 tonnes.\n                                                                                                 In the next periods the tonnage that was overcharged is deducted from the tonnage that is subject to the additional waste gate fee (Rev 3).

The authority waste is split into a guaranteed tonnage amount and an additional tonnage amount. \nIf the authority tonnage received in a given period is less than the guaranteed tonnage amount, then \nrevenue is still received for the “missing” tonnage. Tonnage which is paid for but not received in this \nmanner is written off against additional tonnage in later quarters. \nThere is a subcontractor which processes the waste and charges a fee proportional to the amount of \nwaste that is incinerated. Once processed, waste is either incinerated, recycled or landfilled. The revenue \nreceived from the recycling and the cost of landfill is passed through to the operator. \nThe flowchart on the following page describes how the total waste processed in each quarter is split into \ndifferent categories. On the flowchart, the numbers in brackets next to each waste stream indicate the cost \nand revenue types which apply to that waste stream. The different revenues and costs are described in \nthe table below. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated, they are given in 2017 prices. Depending on the terms of the contracts \nwith various parties, the inflation for each revenue or cost item steps annually or quarterly, and at the \nagreed rate for that line item. \nInflation should be applied such that a full year of inflation has been applied on or by 1 January of each \nsubsequent year (i.e. for all inflation indices the value of the index on 1 January 2019 should reflect \nexactly one year of inflation).  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations.  \nYour model should be quarterly and cover the period from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2030.  \n \n \nFor Questions 41 to 48, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 49 to 50, you are required to type in your answer.\n \nWASTE FLOW CHART\n \n*this is given in the inputs file on a quarterly basis \nSee the image for the flow chart.\n\nAPPLICABLE COSTS AND REVENUES \n\nCost or Revenue                    Cost                       Inflation                          Notes\nRev 1 (Third party waste gate fees) $50 per tonne              2.5% per annum applied annually\n\nRev 2 (Guaranteed waste gate fees)  $45 per tonne              2% per annum applied annually      If the guaranteed wasteflow in a quarter is less than 75,000 tonnes the fee must be paid as though the wasteflow were 75,000 tonnes.\n                                                                                                 In the next periods the tonnage that was overcharged is deducted from the tonnage that is subject to the additional waste gate fee (Rev 3). Overcharged tonnage is carried forward until fully written off against additional waste.\n\nRev 3 (Additional waste gate fees)  $70 per tonne              Not inflated                       See the note under Rev 2 for calculating the tonnage amount used for this revenue.\n                                                                                                 The additional waste revenue is then subject to a payment delay of one quarter.

The authority waste is split into a guaranteed tonnage amount and an additional tonnage amount. \nIf the authority tonnage received in a given period is less than the guaranteed tonnage amount, then \nrevenue is still received for the “missing” tonnage. Tonnage which is paid for but not received in this \nmanner is written off against additional tonnage in later quarters. \nThere is a subcontractor which processes the waste and charges a fee proportional to the amount of \nwaste that is incinerated. Once processed, waste is either incinerated, recycled or landfilled. The revenue \nreceived from the recycling and the cost of landfill is passed through to the operator. \nThe flowchart on the following page describes how the total waste processed in each quarter is split into \ndifferent categories. On the flowchart, the numbers in brackets next to each waste stream indicate the cost \nand revenue types which apply to that waste stream. The different revenues and costs are described in \nthe table below. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated, they are given in 2017 prices. Depending on the terms of the contracts \nwith various parties, the inflation for each revenue or cost item steps annually or quarterly, and at the \nagreed rate for that line item. \nInflation should be applied such that a full year of inflation has been applied on or by 1 January of each \nsubsequent year (i.e. for all inflation indices the value of the index on 1 January 2019 should reflect \nexactly one year of inflation).  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations.  \nYour model should be quarterly and cover the period from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2030.  \n \n \nFor Questions 41 to 48, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 49 to 50, you are required to type in your answer.\n \nWASTE FLOW CHART\n \n*this is given in the inputs file on a quarterly basis \nSee the image for the flow chart.\n\nAPPLICABLE COSTS AND REVENUES \n\nCost or Revenue                    Cost                       Inflation                          Notes\nRev 1 (Third party waste gate fees) $50 per tonne              2.5% per annum applied annually\n\nRev 2 (Guaranteed waste gate fees)  $45 per tonne              2% per annum applied annually      If the guaranteed wasteflow in a quarter is less than 75,000 tonnes the fee must be paid as though the wasteflow were 75,000 tonnes.\n                                                                                                 In the next periods the tonnage that was overcharged is deducted from the tonnage that is subject to the additional waste gate fee (Rev 3). Overcharged tonnage is carried forward until fully written off against additional waste.\n\nRev 3 (Additional waste gate fees)  $70 per tonne              Not inflated                       See the note under Rev 2 for calculating the tonnage amount used for this revenue.\n                                                                                                 The additional waste revenue is then subject to a payment delay of one quarter. Assume that no revenue is due for waste that is received prior to the start of the modelled timeline.\n\nRev 4 (Silver recycling)            $18 per oz                 2.5% per annum applied at the      35,274 oz to a tonne.\n                                                               start of each quarter\n\nRev 5 (Copper recycling)            $3 per oz                  2.5% per annum applied at the      35,274 oz to a tonne.\n                                                               start of each quarter\n\nRev 6 (Iron recycling)              $150 per tonne             1.5% per annum applied at the      35,274 oz to a tonne.\n                                                               start of each quarter\n\nCost 1 (incinerator running costs)  $70,000 per annum          2.0% per annum applied annually    Paid in May.\n\nCost 2 (incinerator processing      $20 per incineration tonne 2.0% per annum applied annually\ncosts)\n\nCost 3 (landfill costs)             $150 per landfill tonne    2.0% per annum applied annually\n\nCost 4 (landfill penalty)           $500,000 per annum         5% per annum applied annually      Paid in December if the total waste landfilled in the current year is greater than 65,500 tonnes.\n\nQuestion 50 What are the total cash revenues received less total costs paid in the year 2027?

turns.\n    o For each turn, roll one six-sided die 6 times, making a note of each number in the order it\nwas rolled. \n    o Once you have your list of six numbers, determine the possible scores for the turn\naccording to the categories below. \n• For each game, score the game by finding the highest possible combined score from the two\nturns, noting that no category may be used more than once (i.e. you may not score the two hands \nin the same category). \nAs you have a keen interest in statistics, you have decided to simulate several games in Excel and \nanalyze the resulting scores.  Questions 20 to 26 require only the ‘turn’ results.  Questions 27 to 29 \nrequire analysis of the ‘game’ results. \nThe workbook provided contains dice rolls from 6,000 simulated turns (3,000 games).  Use the rules \nbelow to first determine the possible scores for the turns, and then to find the highest possible score for \neach game.\n\nSCORING TURNS \n\nCategory                Criteria                     Score\nHigh and Often          Any turn                     The highest number rolled in the turn multiplied by the number of times it was rolled that turn\n\nSummation               Any turn                     Sum of all six dice rolls\n\nHighs and Lows          Any turn                     The highest number rolled multiplied by the lowest number rolled multiplied by the difference between them\n\nOnly two numbers        The six rolls are all one    30\n                        of two numbers\n                        (e.g. 3-6-3-6-6-6)\n\nAll the numbers         The rolls are (in any order) 40\n                        1-2-3-4-5-6\n\nOrdered subset of four  When listed in the order     50\n                        rolled the numbers contain\n                        a run of 4 consecutive\n                        increasing or decreasing\n                        numbers (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or\n                        5-4-3-2)\n\nFor Questions 20 to 27, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 28 to 29, you are required to type in your answer. \n\nQuestion 20 If all turns were scored as “High and Often” what would the total score for all 6,000 turns be?

consists of 2 turns.\n    o For each turn, roll one six-sided die 6 times, making a note of each number in the order it\nwas rolled. \n    o Once you have your list of six numbers, determine the possible scores for the turn\naccording to the categories below. \n• For each game, score the game by finding the highest possible combined score from the two\nturns, noting that no category may be used more than once (i.e. you may not score the two hands \nin the same category). \nAs you have a keen interest in statistics, you have decided to simulate several games in Excel and \nanalyze the resulting scores.  Questions 20 to 26 require only the ‘turn’ results.  Questions 27 to 29 \nrequire analysis of the ‘game’ results. \nThe workbook provided contains dice rolls from 6,000 simulated turns (3,000 games).  Use the rules \nbelow to first determine the possible scores for the turns, and then to find the highest possible score for \neach game.\n\nSCORING TURNS \n\nCategory                Criteria                     Score\nHigh and Often          Any turn                     The highest number rolled in the turn multiplied by the number of times it was rolled that turn\n\nSummation               Any turn                     Sum of all six dice rolls\n\nHighs and Lows          Any turn                     The highest number rolled multiplied by the lowest number rolled multiplied by the difference between them\n\nOnly two numbers        The six rolls are all one    30\n                        of two numbers\n                        (e.g. 3-6-3-6-6-6)\n\nAll the numbers         The rolls are (in any order) 40\n                        1-2-3-4-5-6\n\nOrdered subset of four  When listed in the order     50\n                        rolled the numbers contain\n                        a run of 4 consecutive\n                        increasing or decreasing\n                        numbers (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or\n                        5-4-3-2)\n\nFor Questions 20 to 27, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 28 to 29, you are required to type in your answer. \n\nQuestion 21 What is the most common score that would be attained if all 6,000 turns were scored under the ‘Summation’ category?

which the rules are as follows: \n• Each game consists of 2 turns.\n    o For each turn, roll one six-sided die 6 times, making a note of each number in the order it\nwas rolled. \n    o Once you have your list of six numbers, determine the possible scores for the turn\naccording to the categories below. \n• For each game, score the game by finding the highest possible combined score from the two\nturns, noting that no category may be used more than once (i.e. you may not score the two hands \nin the same category). \nAs you have a keen interest in statistics, you have decided to simulate several games in Excel and \nanalyze the resulting scores.  Questions 20 to 26 require only the ‘turn’ results.  Questions 27 to 29 \nrequire analysis of the ‘game’ results. \nThe workbook provided contains dice rolls from 6,000 simulated turns (3,000 games).  Use the rules \nbelow to first determine the possible scores for the turns, and then to find the highest possible score for \neach game.\n\nSCORING TURNS \n\nCategory                Criteria                     Score\nHigh and Often          Any turn                     The highest number rolled in the turn multiplied by the number of times it was rolled that turn\n\nSummation               Any turn                     Sum of all six dice rolls\n\nHighs and Lows          Any turn                     The highest number rolled multiplied by the lowest number rolled multiplied by the difference between them\n\nOnly two numbers        The six rolls are all one    30\n                        of two numbers\n                        (e.g. 3-6-3-6-6-6)\n\nAll the numbers         The rolls are (in any order) 40\n                        1-2-3-4-5-6\n\nOrdered subset of four  When listed in the order     50\n                        rolled the numbers contain\n                        a run of 4 consecutive\n                        increasing or decreasing\n                        numbers (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or\n                        5-4-3-2)\n\nFor Questions 20 to 27, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 28 to 29, you are required to type in your answer. \n\nQuestion 22 What is the best possible score using the ‘Highs and Lows’ category?

which the rules are as follows: \n• Each game consists of 2 turns.\n    o For each turn, roll one six-sided die 6 times, making a note of each number in the order it\nwas rolled. \n    o Once you have your list of six numbers, determine the possible scores for the turn\naccording to the categories below. \n• For each game, score the game by finding the highest possible combined score from the two\nturns, noting that no category may be used more than once (i.e. you may not score the two hands \nin the same category). \nAs you have a keen interest in statistics, you have decided to simulate several games in Excel and \nanalyze the resulting scores.  Questions 20 to 26 require only the ‘turn’ results.  Questions 27 to 29 \nrequire analysis of the ‘game’ results. \nThe workbook provided contains dice rolls from 6,000 simulated turns (3,000 games).  Use the rules \nbelow to first determine the possible scores for the turns, and then to find the highest possible score for \neach game.\n\nSCORING TURNS \n\nCategory                Criteria                     Score\nHigh and Often          Any turn                     The highest number rolled in the turn multiplied by the number of times it was rolled that turn\n\nSummation               Any turn                     Sum of all six dice rolls\n\nHighs and Lows          Any turn                     The highest number rolled multiplied by the lowest number rolled multiplied by the difference between them\n\nOnly two numbers        The six rolls are all one    30\n                        of two numbers\n                        (e.g. 3-6-3-6-6-6)\n\nAll the numbers         The rolls are (in any order) 40\n                        1-2-3-4-5-6\n\nOrdered subset of four  When listed in the order     50\n                        rolled the numbers contain\n                        a run of 4 consecutive\n                        increasing or decreasing\n                        numbers (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or\n                        5-4-3-2)\n\nFor Questions 20 to 27, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 28 to 29, you are required to type in your answer. \n\nQuestion 25 How many turns qualify to be scored as ‘Ordered Subset of Four’?

                             DSBench/data/00000005, INTRODUCTION\nYou have been playing a game in which the rules are as follows: \n• Each game consists of 2 turns.\n    o For each turn, roll one six-sided die 6 times, making a note of each number in the order it\nwas rolled. \n    o Once you have your list of six numbers, determine the possible scores for the turn\naccording to the categories below. \n• For each game, score the game by finding the highest possible combined score from the two\nturns, noting that no category may be used more than once (i.e. you may not score the two hands \nin the same category). \nAs you have a keen interest in statistics, you have decided to simulate several games in Excel and \nanalyze the resulting scores.  Questions 20 to 26 require only the ‘turn’ results.  Questions 27 to 29 \nrequire analysis of the ‘game’ results. \nThe workbook provided contains dice rolls from 6,000 simulated turns (3,000 games).  Use the rules \nbelow to first determine the possible scores for the turns, and then to find the highest possible score for \neach game.\n\nSCORING TURNS \n\nCategory                Criteria                     Score\nHigh and Often          Any turn                     The highest number rolled in the turn multiplied by the number of times it was rolled that turn\n\nSummation               Any turn                     Sum of all six dice rolls\n\nHighs and Lows          Any turn                     The highest number rolled multiplied by the lowest number rolled multiplied by the difference between them\n\nOnly two numbers        The six rolls are all one    30\n                        of two numbers\n                        (e.g. 3-6-3-6-6-6)\n\nAll the numbers         The rolls are (in any order) 40\n                        1-2-3-4-5-6\n\nOrdered subset of four  When listed in the order     50\n                        rolled the numbers contain\n                        a run of 4 consecutive\n                        increasing or decreasing\n                        numbers (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or\n                        5-4-3-2)\n\nFor Questions 20 to 27, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 28 to 29, you are required to type in your answer. \n\nQuestion 26 If all turns were scored according to their second highest scoring category, what would the total score for all the turns be?

DSBench/data/00000005, INTRODUCTION\nYou have been playing a game in which the rules are as follows: \n• Each game consists of 2 turns.\n    o For each turn, roll one six-sided die 6 times, making a note of each number in the order it\nwas rolled. \n    o Once you have your list of six numbers, determine the possible scores for the turn\naccording to the categories below. \n• For each game, score the game by finding the highest possible combined score from the two\nturns, noting that no category may be used more than once (i.e. you may not score the two hands \nin the same category). \nAs you have a keen interest in statistics, you have decided to simulate several games in Excel and \nanalyze the resulting scores.  Questions 20 to 26 require only the ‘turn’ results.  Questions 27 to 29 \nrequire analysis of the ‘game’ results. \nThe workbook provided contains dice rolls from 6,000 simulated turns (3,000 games).  Use the rules \nbelow to first determine the possible scores for the turns, and then to find the highest possible score for \neach game.\n\nSCORING TURNS \n\nCategory                Criteria                     Score\nHigh and Often          Any turn                     The highest number rolled in the turn multiplied by the number of times it was rolled that turn\n\nSummation               Any turn                     Sum of all six dice rolls\n\nHighs and Lows          Any turn                     The highest number rolled multiplied by the lowest number rolled multiplied by the difference between them\n\nOnly two numbers        The six rolls are all one    30\n                        of two numbers\n                        (e.g. 3-6-3-6-6-6)\n\nAll the numbers         The rolls are (in any order) 40\n                        1-2-3-4-5-6\n\nOrdered subset of four  When listed in the order     50\n                        rolled the numbers contain\n                        a run of 4 consecutive\n                        increasing or decreasing\n                        numbers (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or\n                        5-4-3-2)\n\nFor Questions 20 to 27, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 28 to 29, you are required to type in your answer. \n\nQuestion 27 Grouping the turns into games, you can identify the highest game score achieved. How many of the 3,000 games achieve this maximum score? Remember that no scoring category may be used more than once per game. A. 4 B. 5 C.6 D. 7 E. 8 F. 9 G. 10 H. 11 I. 12

follows: \n• Each game consists of 2 turns.\n    o For each turn, roll one six-sided die 6 times, making a note of each number in the order it\nwas rolled. \n    o Once you have your list of six numbers, determine the possible scores for the turn\naccording to the categories below. \n• For each game, score the game by finding the highest possible combined score from the two\nturns, noting that no category may be used more than once (i.e. you may not score the two hands \nin the same category). \nAs you have a keen interest in statistics, you have decided to simulate several games in Excel and \nanalyze the resulting scores.  Questions 20 to 26 require only the ‘turn’ results.  Questions 27 to 29 \nrequire analysis of the ‘game’ results. \nThe workbook provided contains dice rolls from 6,000 simulated turns (3,000 games).  Use the rules \nbelow to first determine the possible scores for the turns, and then to find the highest possible score for \neach game.\n\nSCORING TURNS \n\nCategory                Criteria                     Score\nHigh and Often          Any turn                     The highest number rolled in the turn multiplied by the number of times it was rolled that turn\n\nSummation               Any turn                     Sum of all six dice rolls\n\nHighs and Lows          Any turn                     The highest number rolled multiplied by the lowest number rolled multiplied by the difference between them\n\nOnly two numbers        The six rolls are all one    30\n                        of two numbers\n                        (e.g. 3-6-3-6-6-6)\n\nAll the numbers         The rolls are (in any order) 40\n                        1-2-3-4-5-6\n\nOrdered subset of four  When listed in the order     50\n                        rolled the numbers contain\n                        a run of 4 consecutive\n                        increasing or decreasing\n                        numbers (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or\n                        5-4-3-2)\n\nFor Questions 20 to 27, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 28 to 29, you are required to type in your answer. \n\nQuestion 28 What is the total score for all the games? Type in your answer, without any thousands separator (if relevant). E.g. 1,000,000 should be typed as 1000000

each turn, roll one six-sided die 6 times, making a note of each number in the order it\nwas rolled. \n    o Once you have your list of six numbers, determine the possible scores for the turn\naccording to the categories below. \n• For each game, score the game by finding the highest possible combined score from the two\nturns, noting that no category may be used more than once (i.e. you may not score the two hands \nin the same category). \nAs you have a keen interest in statistics, you have decided to simulate several games in Excel and \nanalyze the resulting scores.  Questions 20 to 26 require only the ‘turn’ results.  Questions 27 to 29 \nrequire analysis of the ‘game’ results. \nThe workbook provided contains dice rolls from 6,000 simulated turns (3,000 games).  Use the rules \nbelow to first determine the possible scores for the turns, and then to find the highest possible score for \neach game.\n\nSCORING TURNS \n\nCategory                Criteria                     Score\nHigh and Often          Any turn                     The highest number rolled in the turn multiplied by the number of times it was rolled that turn\n\nSummation               Any turn                     Sum of all six dice rolls\n\nHighs and Lows          Any turn                     The highest number rolled multiplied by the lowest number rolled multiplied by the difference between them\n\nOnly two numbers        The six rolls are all one    30\n                        of two numbers\n                        (e.g. 3-6-3-6-6-6)\n\nAll the numbers         The rolls are (in any order) 40\n                        1-2-3-4-5-6\n\nOrdered subset of four  When listed in the order     50\n                        rolled the numbers contain\n                        a run of 4 consecutive\n                        increasing or decreasing\n                        numbers (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or\n                        5-4-3-2)\n\nFor Questions 20 to 27, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 28 to 29, you are required to type in your answer. \n\nQuestion 29 If the odd numbered games are played by Player 1, and the even numbered games are played by Player 2, and they are matched off against each other (e.g. game 1 vs game 2, game 3 vs game 4) what is the value of (Number of matches won by Player 1) minus (Number of matches won by Player 2)?

Excelstan is a small \ncountry and is divided into 9 Districts, named after letters of the Greek alphabet.  Each District elects one \nmember to Congress.  There are 1000 voters.  Each voter is assigned a District Code based on where \nthey live.  The District Code is a number between 105 and 194 and determines what District the voter \nvotes for. \nDistrict Code | District\n105 - 114 Alpha\n115 - 124 Beta\n125 - 134 Gamma\n135 - 144 Delta\n145 - 154 Epsilon\n155 - 164 Zeta\n165 - 174 Eta\n175 - 184 Theta\n185 - 194 Iota\n \nThere are 8 political parties in Excelstan competing for seats in the Congress. \nThe parties are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown and Black. \nVoters cast their ballot by numbering 1 against their first choice.  After this, they can choose to provide \npreferences by numbering 2 against their second choice, 3 against their third choice, and so on up to 8 \nagainst their eighth choice.  Voters can choose how far down they give preferences to. In the data \nprovided, every voter has voted for either 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 parties in preferential order. \nWhen counting votes, if a voter has not provided a preference number against a particular party, assume \nthey gave that party an 8 (i.e. they ranked any unmarked party equal last). \nEach District is counted independently of the other Districts, using only the votes from that \nDistrict. \nCOUNTING THE VOTES \nExcelstan has two different systems for counting votes to determine which party wins each District. \nCounting System 1: First Past The Post \nCounting System 2: Points Allocation (also known as ‘Eurovision style’) \n\nCOUNTING SYSTEM 1: FIRST PAST THE POST \nThe party with the most number of “1” votes wins.  If two or more parties tie for the most number of “1” \nvotes, then the winner is the party that received the most “2” votes (from the set of parties that tied for the \nmost “1” votes).  If there is still a tie, then count the “3” votes and so on until a winner is determined. \n \nCOUNTING SYSTEM 2: POINTS ALLOCATION \nParties receive points for each vote.

Excelstan is a small \ncountry and is divided into 9 Districts, named after letters of the Greek alphabet.  Each District elects one \nmember to Congress.  There are 1000 voters.  Each voter is assigned a District Code based on where \nthey live.  The District Code is a number between 105 and 194 and determines what District the voter \nvotes for. \nDistrict Code | District\n105 - 114 Alpha\n115 - 124 Beta\n125 - 134 Gamma\n135 - 144 Delta\n145 - 154 Epsilon\n155 - 164 Zeta\n165 - 174 Eta\n175 - 184 Theta\n185 - 194 Iota\n \nThere are 8 political parties in Excelstan competing for seats in the Congress. \nThe parties are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown and Black. \nVoters cast their ballot by numbering 1 against their first choice.  After this, they can choose to provide \npreferences by numbering 2 against their second choice, 3 against their third choice, and so on up to 8 \nagainst their eighth choice.  Voters can choose how far down they give preferences to. In the data \nprovided, every voter has voted for either 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 parties in preferential order. \nWhen counting votes, if a voter has not provided a preference number against a particular party, assume \nthey gave that party an 8 (i.e. they ranked any unmarked party equal last). \nEach District is counted independently of the other Districts, using only the votes from that \nDistrict. \nCOUNTING THE VOTES \nExcelstan has two different systems for counting votes to determine which party wins each District. \nCounting System 1: First Past The Post \nCounting System 2: Points Allocation (also known as ‘Eurovision style’) \n\nCOUNTING SYSTEM 1: FIRST PAST THE POST \nThe party with the most number of “1” votes wins.  If two or more parties tie for the most number of “1” \nvotes, then the winner is the party that received the most “2” votes (from the set of parties that tied for the \nmost “1” votes).  If there is still a tie, then count the “3” votes and so on until a winner is determined. \n \nCOUNTING SYSTEM 2: POINTS ALLOCATION \nParties receive points for each vote. The better the preference, the more points received. \n\nVote Preference    Points\n1                  12\n2                  10\n3                  8\n4                  6\n5                  4\n6                  2\n7                  1\n8                  0\n\n \nThe party with the highest number of points wins the District. \n \nThe workbook provided contains all of the voting data.

Excelstan is a small \ncountry and is divided into 9 Districts, named after letters of the Greek alphabet.  Each District elects one \nmember to Congress.  There are 1000 voters.  Each voter is assigned a District Code based on where \nthey live.  The District Code is a number between 105 and 194 and determines what District the voter \nvotes for. \nDistrict Code | District\n105 - 114 Alpha\n115 - 124 Beta\n125 - 134 Gamma\n135 - 144 Delta\n145 - 154 Epsilon\n155 - 164 Zeta\n165 - 174 Eta\n175 - 184 Theta\n185 - 194 Iota\n \nThere are 8 political parties in Excelstan competing for seats in the Congress. \nThe parties are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown and Black. \nVoters cast their ballot by numbering 1 against their first choice.  After this, they can choose to provide \npreferences by numbering 2 against their second choice, 3 against their third choice, and so on up to 8 \nagainst their eighth choice.  Voters can choose how far down they give preferences to. In the data \nprovided, every voter has voted for either 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 parties in preferential order. \nWhen counting votes, if a voter has not provided a preference number against a particular party, assume \nthey gave that party an 8 (i.e. they ranked any unmarked party equal last). \nEach District is counted independently of the other Districts, using only the votes from that \nDistrict. \nCOUNTING THE VOTES \nExcelstan has two different systems for counting votes to determine which party wins each District. \nCounting System 1: First Past The Post \nCounting System 2: Points Allocation (also known as ‘Eurovision style’) \n\nCOUNTING SYSTEM 1: FIRST PAST THE POST \nThe party with the most number of “1” votes wins.  If two or more parties tie for the most number of “1” \nvotes, then the winner is the party that received the most “2” votes (from the set of parties that tied for the \nmost “1” votes).  If there is still a tie, then count the “3” votes and so on until a winner is determined. \n \nCOUNTING SYSTEM 2: POINTS ALLOCATION \nParties receive points for each vote.

Excelstan is a small \ncountry and is divided into 9 Districts, named after letters of the Greek alphabet.  Each District elects one \nmember to Congress.  There are 1000 voters.  Each voter is assigned a District Code based on where \nthey live.  The District Code is a number between 105 and 194 and determines what District the voter \nvotes for. \nDistrict Code | District\n105 - 114 Alpha\n115 - 124 Beta\n125 - 134 Gamma\n135 - 144 Delta\n145 - 154 Epsilon\n155 - 164 Zeta\n165 - 174 Eta\n175 - 184 Theta\n185 - 194 Iota\n \nThere are 8 political parties in Excelstan competing for seats in the Congress. \nThe parties are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown and Black. \nVoters cast their ballot by numbering 1 against their first choice.  After this, they can choose to provide \npreferences by numbering 2 against their second choice, 3 against their third choice, and so on up to 8 \nagainst their eighth choice.  Voters can choose how far down they give preferences to. In the data \nprovided, every voter has voted for either 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 parties in preferential order. \nWhen counting votes, if a voter has not provided a preference number against a particular party, assume \nthey gave that party an 8 (i.e. they ranked any unmarked party equal last). \nEach District is counted independently of the other Districts, using only the votes from that \nDistrict. \nCOUNTING THE VOTES \nExcelstan has two different systems for counting votes to determine which party wins each District. \nCounting System 1: First Past The Post \nCounting System 2: Points Allocation (also known as ‘Eurovision style’) \n\nCOUNTING SYSTEM 1: FIRST PAST THE POST \nThe party with the most number of “1” votes wins.  If two or more parties tie for the most number of “1” \nvotes, then the winner is the party that received the most “2” votes (from the set of parties that tied for the \nmost “1” votes).  If there is still a tie, then count the “3” votes and so on until a winner is determined. \n \nCOUNTING SYSTEM 2: POINTS ALLOCATION \nParties receive points for each vote. The better the preference, the more points received. \n\nVote Preference    Points\n1                  12\n2                  10\n3                  8\n4                  6\n5                  4\n6                  2\n7                  1\n8                  0\n\n \nThe party with the highest number of points wins the District. \n \nThe workbook provided contains all of the voting data.

Excelstan is a small \ncountry and is divided into 9 Districts, named after letters of the Greek alphabet.  Each District elects one \nmember to Congress.  There are 1000 voters.  Each voter is assigned a District Code based on where \nthey live.  The District Code is a number between 105 and 194 and determines what District the voter \nvotes for. \nDistrict Code | District\n105 - 114 Alpha\n115 - 124 Beta\n125 - 134 Gamma\n135 - 144 Delta\n145 - 154 Epsilon\n155 - 164 Zeta\n165 - 174 Eta\n175 - 184 Theta\n185 - 194 Iota\n \nThere are 8 political parties in Excelstan competing for seats in the Congress. \nThe parties are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown and Black. \nVoters cast their ballot by numbering 1 against their first choice.  After this, they can choose to provide \npreferences by numbering 2 against their second choice, 3 against their third choice, and so on up to 8 \nagainst their eighth choice.  Voters can choose how far down they give preferences to. In the data \nprovided, every voter has voted for either 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 parties in preferential order. \nWhen counting votes, if a voter has not provided a preference number against a particular party, assume \nthey gave that party an 8 (i.e. they ranked any unmarked party equal last). \nEach District is counted independently of the other Districts, using only the votes from that \nDistrict. \nCOUNTING THE VOTES \nExcelstan has two different systems for counting votes to determine which party wins each District. \nCounting System 1: First Past The Post \nCounting System 2: Points Allocation (also known as ‘Eurovision style’) \n\nCOUNTING SYSTEM 1: FIRST PAST THE POST \nThe party with the most number of “1” votes wins.  If two or more parties tie for the most number of “1” \nvotes, then the winner is the party that received the most “2” votes (from the set of parties that tied for the \nmost “1” votes).  If there is still a tie, then count the “3” votes and so on until a winner is determined. \n \nCOUNTING SYSTEM 2: POINTS ALLOCATION \nParties receive points for each vote. The better the preference, the more points received. \n\nVote Preference    Points\n1                  12\n2                  10\n3                  8\n4                  6\n5                  4\n6                  2\n7                  1\n8                  0\n\n \nThe party with the highest number of points wins the District. \n \nThe workbook provided contains all of the voting data.

Excelstan is a small \ncountry and is divided into 9 Districts, named after letters of the Greek alphabet.  Each District elects one \nmember to Congress.  There are 1000 voters.  Each voter is assigned a District Code based on where \nthey live.  The District Code is a number between 105 and 194 and determines what District the voter \nvotes for. \nDistrict Code | District\n105 - 114 Alpha\n115 - 124 Beta\n125 - 134 Gamma\n135 - 144 Delta\n145 - 154 Epsilon\n155 - 164 Zeta\n165 - 174 Eta\n175 - 184 Theta\n185 - 194 Iota\n \nThere are 8 political parties in Excelstan competing for seats in the Congress. \nThe parties are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown and Black. \nVoters cast their ballot by numbering 1 against their first choice.  After this, they can choose to provide \npreferences by numbering 2 against their second choice, 3 against their third choice, and so on up to 8 \nagainst their eighth choice.  Voters can choose how far down they give preferences to. In the data \nprovided, every voter has voted for either 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 parties in preferential order. \nWhen counting votes, if a voter has not provided a preference number against a particular party, assume \nthey gave that party an 8 (i.e. they ranked any unmarked party equal last). \nEach District is counted independently of the other Districts, using only the votes from that \nDistrict. \nCOUNTING THE VOTES \nExcelstan has two different systems for counting votes to determine which party wins each District. \nCounting System 1: First Past The Post \nCounting System 2: Points Allocation (also known as ‘Eurovision style’) \n\nCOUNTING SYSTEM 1: FIRST PAST THE POST \nThe party with the most number of “1” votes wins.  If two or more parties tie for the most number of “1” \nvotes, then the winner is the party that received the most “2” votes (from the set of parties that tied for the \nmost “1” votes).  If there is still a tie, then count the “3” votes and so on until a winner is determined. \n \nCOUNTING SYSTEM 2: POINTS ALLOCATION \nParties receive points for each vote. The better the preference, the more points received. \n\nVote Preference    Points\n1                  12\n2                  10\n3                  8\n4                  6\n5                  4\n6                  2\n7                  1\n8                  0\n\n \nThe party with the highest number of points wins the District. \n \nThe workbook provided contains all of the voting data.

Excelstan is a small \ncountry and is divided into 9 Districts, named after letters of the Greek alphabet.  Each District elects one \nmember to Congress.  There are 1000 voters.  Each voter is assigned a District Code based on where \nthey live.  The District Code is a number between 105 and 194 and determines what District the voter \nvotes for. \nDistrict Code | District\n105 - 114 Alpha\n115 - 124 Beta\n125 - 134 Gamma\n135 - 144 Delta\n145 - 154 Epsilon\n155 - 164 Zeta\n165 - 174 Eta\n175 - 184 Theta\n185 - 194 Iota\n \nThere are 8 political parties in Excelstan competing for seats in the Congress. \nThe parties are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown and Black. \nVoters cast their ballot by numbering 1 against their first choice.  After this, they can choose to provide \npreferences by numbering 2 against their second choice, 3 against their third choice, and so on up to 8 \nagainst their eighth choice.  Voters can choose how far down they give preferences to. In the data \nprovided, every voter has voted for either 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 parties in preferential order. \nWhen counting votes, if a voter has not provided a preference number against a particular party, assume \nthey gave that party an 8 (i.e. they ranked any unmarked party equal last). \nEach District is counted independently of the other Districts, using only the votes from that \nDistrict. \nCOUNTING THE VOTES \nExcelstan has two different systems for counting votes to determine which party wins each District. \nCounting System 1: First Past The Post \nCounting System 2: Points Allocation (also known as ‘Eurovision style’) \n\nCOUNTING SYSTEM 1: FIRST PAST THE POST \nThe party with the most number of “1” votes wins.  If two or more parties tie for the most number of “1” \nvotes, then the winner is the party that received the most “2” votes (from the set of parties that tied for the \nmost “1” votes).  If there is still a tie, then count the “3” votes and so on until a winner is determined. \n \nCOUNTING SYSTEM 2: POINTS ALLOCATION \nParties receive points for each vote. The better the preference, the more points received. \n\nVote Preference    Points\n1                  12\n2                  10\n3                  8\n4                  6\n5                  4\n6                  2\n7                  1\n8                  0\n\n \nThe party with the highest number of points wins the District. \n \nThe workbook provided contains all of the voting data.

Excelstan is a small \ncountry and is divided into 9 Districts, named after letters of the Greek alphabet.  Each District elects one \nmember to Congress.  There are 1000 voters.  Each voter is assigned a District Code based on where \nthey live.  The District Code is a number between 105 and 194 and determines what District the voter \nvotes for. \nDistrict Code | District\n105 - 114 Alpha\n115 - 124 Beta\n125 - 134 Gamma\n135 - 144 Delta\n145 - 154 Epsilon\n155 - 164 Zeta\n165 - 174 Eta\n175 - 184 Theta\n185 - 194 Iota\n \nThere are 8 political parties in Excelstan competing for seats in the Congress. \nThe parties are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown and Black. \nVoters cast their ballot by numbering 1 against their first choice.  After this, they can choose to provide \npreferences by numbering 2 against their second choice, 3 against their third choice, and so on up to 8 \nagainst their eighth choice.  Voters can choose how far down they give preferences to. In the data \nprovided, every voter has voted for either 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 parties in preferential order. \nWhen counting votes, if a voter has not provided a preference number against a particular party, assume \nthey gave that party an 8 (i.e. they ranked any unmarked party equal last). \nEach District is counted independently of the other Districts, using only the votes from that \nDistrict. \nCOUNTING THE VOTES \nExcelstan has two different systems for counting votes to determine which party wins each District. \nCounting System 1: First Past The Post \nCounting System 2: Points Allocation (also known as ‘Eurovision style’) \n\nCOUNTING SYSTEM 1: FIRST PAST THE POST \nThe party with the most number of “1” votes wins.  If two or more parties tie for the most number of “1” \nvotes, then the winner is the party that received the most “2” votes (from the set of parties that tied for the \nmost “1” votes).  If there is still a tie, then count the “3” votes and so on until a winner is determined. \n \nCOUNTING SYSTEM 2: POINTS ALLOCATION \nParties receive points for each vote.

Excelstan is a small \ncountry and is divided into 9 Districts, named after letters of the Greek alphabet.  Each District elects one \nmember to Congress.  There are 1000 voters.  Each voter is assigned a District Code based on where \nthey live.  The District Code is a number between 105 and 194 and determines what District the voter \nvotes for. \nDistrict Code | District\n105 - 114 Alpha\n115 - 124 Beta\n125 - 134 Gamma\n135 - 144 Delta\n145 - 154 Epsilon\n155 - 164 Zeta\n165 - 174 Eta\n175 - 184 Theta\n185 - 194 Iota\n \nThere are 8 political parties in Excelstan competing for seats in the Congress. \nThe parties are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown and Black. \nVoters cast their ballot by numbering 1 against their first choice.  After this, they can choose to provide \npreferences by numbering 2 against their second choice, 3 against their third choice, and so on up to 8 \nagainst their eighth choice.  Voters can choose how far down they give preferences to. In the data \nprovided, every voter has voted for either 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 parties in preferential order. \nWhen counting votes, if a voter has not provided a preference number against a particular party, assume \nthey gave that party an 8 (i.e. they ranked any unmarked party equal last). \nEach District is counted independently of the other Districts, using only the votes from that \nDistrict. \nCOUNTING THE VOTES \nExcelstan has two different systems for counting votes to determine which party wins each District. \nCounting System 1: First Past The Post \nCounting System 2: Points Allocation (also known as ‘Eurovision style’) \n\nCOUNTING SYSTEM 1: FIRST PAST THE POST \nThe party with the most number of “1” votes wins.  If two or more parties tie for the most number of “1” \nvotes, then the winner is the party that received the most “2” votes (from the set of parties that tied for the \nmost “1” votes).  If there is still a tie, then count the “3” votes and so on until a winner is determined. \n \nCOUNTING SYSTEM 2: POINTS ALLOCATION \nParties receive points for each vote. The better the preference, the more points received. \n\nVote Preference    Points\n1                  12\n2                  10\n3                  8\n4                  6\n5                  4\n6                  2\n7                  1\n8                  0\n\n \nThe party with the highest number of points wins the District. \n \nThe workbook provided contains all of the voting data.

Excelstan is a small \ncountry and is divided into 9 Districts, named after letters of the Greek alphabet.  Each District elects one \nmember to Congress.  There are 1000 voters.  Each voter is assigned a District Code based on where \nthey live.  The District Code is a number between 105 and 194 and determines what District the voter \nvotes for. \nDistrict Code | District\n105 - 114 Alpha\n115 - 124 Beta\n125 - 134 Gamma\n135 - 144 Delta\n145 - 154 Epsilon\n155 - 164 Zeta\n165 - 174 Eta\n175 - 184 Theta\n185 - 194 Iota\n \nThere are 8 political parties in Excelstan competing for seats in the Congress. \nThe parties are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown and Black. \nVoters cast their ballot by numbering 1 against their first choice.  After this, they can choose to provide \npreferences by numbering 2 against their second choice, 3 against their third choice, and so on up to 8 \nagainst their eighth choice.  Voters can choose how far down they give preferences to. In the data \nprovided, every voter has voted for either 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 parties in preferential order. \nWhen counting votes, if a voter has not provided a preference number against a particular party, assume \nthey gave that party an 8 (i.e. they ranked any unmarked party equal last). \nEach District is counted independently of the other Districts, using only the votes from that \nDistrict. \nCOUNTING THE VOTES \nExcelstan has two different systems for counting votes to determine which party wins each District. \nCounting System 1: First Past The Post \nCounting System 2: Points Allocation (also known as ‘Eurovision style’) \n\nCOUNTING SYSTEM 1: FIRST PAST THE POST \nThe party with the most number of “1” votes wins.  If two or more parties tie for the most number of “1” \nvotes, then the winner is the party that received the most “2” votes (from the set of parties that tied for the \nmost “1” votes).  If there is still a tie, then count the “3” votes and so on until a winner is determined. \n \nCOUNTING SYSTEM 2: POINTS ALLOCATION \nParties receive points for each vote. The better the preference, the more points received. \n\nVote Preference    Points\n1                  12\n2                  10\n3                  8\n4                  6\n5                  4\n6                  2\n7                  1\n8                  0\n\n \nThe party with the highest number of points wins the District. \n \nThe workbook provided contains all of the voting data.  In order to answer all of the questions, you will \nneed to use the rules of each counting system below to determine the winning party or parties for each \nDistrict under each counting system. \nQuestions 17 to 19 and 26 relate to multiple Counting Systems. \nQuestions 20 to 22 relate to Counting System 1: First Past the Post \nQuestions 23 to 25 relate to Counting System 2: Points Allocation \n \n\nFor Questions 17 to 24, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 25 to 26, you are required to type in your answer.\n\nQuestion 26 Consider all of the Districts that have a different winner when First Past The Post is used compared to when Points Allocation is used. Take the first letter of each of these District names and combine those letters (in the order Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota) to form a word. What is that word?

There is no need to write “k” or “,000” at the end. \nIf submitting a DSCR value, give your answer to 3 decimal places \nIf submitting a percentage rate, give your answer as a percentage to 3 decimal places (e.g. 11.543%) \nIf submitting a date, give your answer rounded to the nearest day. (That’s a joke…) \n\nDETAILS \n1. Purchase Date Cash Flows \nOn the Purchase Date, the debt facility is drawn with a single drawdown and a single equity \ninvestment is made (there are no other equity investments at any time).  The sum of these two \namounts equals the Purchase Price which immediately goes to the State.  In other words, net cash \nflow for the Purchase Date is zero. \n2. Interest Calculations \nInterest is calculated on the last day of each quarter as  \n(Opening Balance in Quarter) * (Rate % p.a.) * (Days in Qtr) / 365 \nThis applies to both the interest owed on the Debt, and the interest earned / (owed) on any positive / \n(negative) cash account balance. \n3. Refinancing Calculations \nThe debt is refinanced at three points throughout the term.  The refinanced amount is the outstanding \ndebt balance immediately after principal repayment on the refinancing date. A fee is charged on the \nrefinanced amount, and this fee is capitalised into the debt balance.  For clarity, there is no fee \npayable on the fee itself.  The fee is only charged on the old balance that is being refinanced. \n4. Debt Interest Payments \nInterest owed is always paid in full at the end of each quarter for the entire life of the debt facility. \n5. Debt Principal Repayments \nDebt is repaid on the last day of each quarter, commencing on the First Debt Repayment Date, \ncontinuing every quarter until the facility is fully repaid.  All debt must be paid off on or before the \nLatest Allowed Debt Maturity Date.  The amount of each repayment must be sculpted so that the \nDSCR is constant for all quarters during the repayment term.  The only exception to this is the final \nrepayment quarter, which can have a higher DSCR.  The repayment amount in any quarter cannot \nexceed the quarterly opening balance of the facility.  Redraws are not permitted. \n6. DSCR \nThe DSCR is defined only for quarters where the principal repayment amount is not zero.  It is equal \neach quarter to the quarterly value of CFADS / (Net Interest Expense + Principal Repayments) \n7. CFADS \nCFADS (Cash Flow Available for Debt Service) is provided by the ‘Operations’ worksheet for each \nquarter.  For clarity, the definition of CFADS does not include any carryover opening balance. \nHint:  Assumptions have been set so that CFADS will be relatively smooth and healthy, and will \nalways be at least as large as Net Interest Expense * Sculpted DSCR \n8. Net Interest Expense \nDefined as: For each quarter, interest owed on Debt plus interest owed on cash account overdraft \nbalance (if any) less interest earned on cash account positive balance (if any).  \n9. Cash Flow Waterfall \nThe Cash Flow Waterfall should include only the following items: \n(1) CFADS; (2) Interest Revenue/(Overdraft Expense) on Cash Balance; (3) Interest Expense \non Debt; (4) Principal Repayments; (5) Equity Distributions \nAll cashflows are assumed to occur on the final day of each quarter. \n10. Equity Distributions \nDistributions occur on the last day of each quarter every June during the Asset life, and at the Asset \nExpiration Date.  All available cash (including the carry over opening balance) is distributed each \ndistribution date, so long as the cash balance is positive immediately prior to distributions. \n11. Equity IRR \nThe Equity IRR should be calculated using the XIRR function, and consider the cashflows to/from \nequity between the Purchase Date and the Asset Expiration Date inclusive. \n \n\nQuestion 1 \nFor Scenario 1, what is the date of the final debt repayment?

(That’s a joke…) \n\nDETAILS \n1. Purchase Date Cash Flows \nOn the Purchase Date, the debt facility is drawn with a single drawdown and a single equity \ninvestment is made (there are no other equity investments at any time).  The sum of these two \namounts equals the Purchase Price which immediately goes to the State.  In other words, net cash \nflow for the Purchase Date is zero. \n2. Interest Calculations \nInterest is calculated on the last day of each quarter as  \n(Opening Balance in Quarter) * (Rate % p.a.) * (Days in Qtr) / 365 \nThis applies to both the interest owed on the Debt, and the interest earned / (owed) on any positive / \n(negative) cash account balance. \n3. Refinancing Calculations \nThe debt is refinanced at three points throughout the term.  The refinanced amount is the outstanding \ndebt balance immediately after principal repayment on the refinancing date. A fee is charged on the \nrefinanced amount, and this fee is capitalised into the debt balance.  For clarity, there is no fee \npayable on the fee itself.  The fee is only charged on the old balance that is being refinanced. \n4. Debt Interest Payments \nInterest owed is always paid in full at the end of each quarter for the entire life of the debt facility. \n5. Debt Principal Repayments \nDebt is repaid on the last day of each quarter, commencing on the First Debt Repayment Date, \ncontinuing every quarter until the facility is fully repaid.  All debt must be paid off on or before the \nLatest Allowed Debt Maturity Date.  The amount of each repayment must be sculpted so that the \nDSCR is constant for all quarters during the repayment term.  The only exception to this is the final \nrepayment quarter, which can have a higher DSCR.  The repayment amount in any quarter cannot \nexceed the quarterly opening balance of the facility.  Redraws are not permitted. \n6. DSCR \nThe DSCR is defined only for quarters where the principal repayment amount is not zero.  It is equal \neach quarter to the quarterly value of CFADS / (Net Interest Expense + Principal Repayments) \n7. CFADS \nCFADS (Cash Flow Available for Debt Service) is provided by the ‘Operations’ worksheet for each \nquarter.  For clarity, the definition of CFADS does not include any carryover opening balance. \nHint:  Assumptions have been set so that CFADS will be relatively smooth and healthy, and will \nalways be at least as large as Net Interest Expense * Sculpted DSCR \n8. Net Interest Expense \nDefined as: For each quarter, interest owed on Debt plus interest owed on cash account overdraft \nbalance (if any) less interest earned on cash account positive balance (if any).  \n9. Cash Flow Waterfall \nThe Cash Flow Waterfall should include only the following items: \n(1) CFADS; (2) Interest Revenue/(Overdraft Expense) on Cash Balance; (3) Interest Expense \non Debt; (4) Principal Repayments; (5) Equity Distributions \nAll cashflows are assumed to occur on the final day of each quarter. \n10. Equity Distributions \nDistributions occur on the last day of each quarter every June during the Asset life, and at the Asset \nExpiration Date.  All available cash (including the carry over opening balance) is distributed each \ndistribution date, so long as the cash balance is positive immediately prior to distributions. \n11. Equity IRR \nThe Equity IRR should be calculated using the XIRR function, and consider the cashflows to/from \nequity between the Purchase Date and the Asset Expiration Date inclusive. \n \n\nQuestion 3 \nFor Scenario 1, what is the Equity IRR?

You have been provided the outline of a \nfinancing model which includes 10 scenarios of Inputs, and 10 scenarios of Operating Cash Flow taken \nfrom a colleague’s forecast operations model. \nFor each of the Input scenarios, most assumption values have been provided, but one or two from each \nscenario will need to be solved for to find the optimal value, subject to the other values provided. \nThe values that may need to be solved for are: \n• First Debt Repayment Date\n• Sculpted DSCR\n• Debt Drawdown amount\n• Equity Investment amount\n• Required Rate of Return (also known as the Equity IRR)\nYour task will be to build the necessary additions to the model so that it can identify the Optimal missing \nvalues for the selected scenario. \nFor the 1st and 2nd dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If solving for First repayment date, the latest possible date; or\nii) If solving for the Sculpted DSCR, the largest possible DSCR\nThat still allows the debt to be repaid by the Latest allowed Debt Maturity Date, without the DSCR ever \nfalling below the Sculpted DSCR value in any given quarter. \n \nFor the 3rd, 4th and 5th dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If not provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Equity IRR, which\nwill then become the Required Rate of Return \nii) If provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Purchase Price whilst\nensuring that the Equity IRR is not less than the Required Rate of Return. \nBuild your model adhering to the included Details, and then answer the Questions. \nFurther conditions (“Requirements of a Solved Model”) are listed at the bottom of the Inputs worksheet. \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 20 are based on the provided input scenarios. \nQuestions 21 to 23 may require you to change some of the existing user-variable input values from certain \nscenarios in order to answer. \n \nPrecision of Answers: \nIf submitting a dollar value, give your answer rounded to the nearest thousand dollar  \n(i.e. 0 decimal places when working in units of [$’000] ). There is no need to write “k” or “,000” at the end. \nIf submitting a DSCR value, give your answer to 3 decimal places \nIf submitting a percentage rate, give your answer as a percentage to 3 decimal places (e.g. 11.543%) \nIf submitting a date, give your answer rounded to the nearest day. (That’s a joke…) \n\nDETAILS \n1. Purchase Date Cash Flows \nOn the Purchase Date, the debt facility is drawn with a single drawdown and a single equity \ninvestment is made (there are no other equity investments at any time).  The sum of these two \namounts equals the Purchase Price which immediately goes to the State.  In other words, net cash \nflow for the Purchase Date is zero. \n2. Interest Calculations \nInterest is calculated on the last day of each quarter as  \n(Opening Balance in Quarter) * (Rate % p.a.) * (Days in Qtr) / 365 \nThis applies to both the interest owed on the Debt, and the interest earned / (owed) on any positive / \n(negative) cash account balance. \n3. Refinancing Calculations \nThe debt is refinanced at three points throughout the term.  The refinanced amount is the outstanding \ndebt balance immediately after principal repayment on the refinancing date. A fee is charged on the \nrefinanced amount, and this fee is capitalised into the debt balance.  For clarity, there is no fee \npayable on the fee itself.  The fee is only charged on the old balance that is being refinanced. \n4. Debt Interest Payments \nInterest owed is always paid in full at the end of each quarter for the entire life of the debt facility. \n5. Debt Principal Repayments \nDebt is repaid on the last day of each quarter, commencing on the First Debt Repayment Date, \ncontinuing every quarter until the facility is fully repaid.  All debt must be paid off on or before the \nLatest Allowed Debt Maturity Date.  The amount of each repayment must be sculpted so that the \nDSCR is constant for all quarters during the repayment term.  The only exception to this is the final \nrepayment quarter, which can have a higher DSCR.  The repayment amount in any quarter cannot \nexceed the quarterly opening balance of the facility.  Redraws are not permitted. \n6. DSCR \nThe DSCR is defined only for quarters where the principal repayment amount is not zero.  It is equal \neach quarter to the quarterly value of CFADS / (Net Interest Expense + Principal Repayments) \n7. CFADS \nCFADS (Cash Flow Available for Debt Service) is provided by the ‘Operations’ worksheet for each \nquarter.  For clarity, the definition of CFADS does not include any carryover opening balance. \nHint:  Assumptions have been set so that CFADS will be relatively smooth and healthy, and will \nalways be at least as large as Net Interest Expense * Sculpted DSCR \n8. Net Interest Expense \nDefined as: For each quarter, interest owed on Debt plus interest owed on cash account overdraft \nbalance (if any) less interest earned on cash account positive balance (if any).  \n9. Cash Flow Waterfall \nThe Cash Flow Waterfall should include only the following items: \n(1) CFADS; (2) Interest Revenue/(Overdraft Expense) on Cash Balance; (3) Interest Expense \non Debt; (4) Principal Repayments; (5) Equity Distributions \nAll cashflows are assumed to occur on the final day of each quarter. \n10. Equity Distributions \nDistributions occur on the last day of each quarter every June during the Asset life, and at the Asset \nExpiration Date.  All available cash (including the carry over opening balance) is distributed each \ndistribution date, so long as the cash balance is positive immediately prior to distributions. \n11. Equity IRR \nThe Equity IRR should be calculated using the XIRR function, and consider the cashflows to/from \nequity between the Purchase Date and the Asset Expiration Date inclusive. \n \n\nQuestion 5 For Scenario 2, what is the Equity \nIRR ? \n[1 mark] \n [1 mark] \n \n

You have been provided the outline of a \nfinancing model which includes 10 scenarios of Inputs, and 10 scenarios of Operating Cash Flow taken \nfrom a colleague’s forecast operations model. \nFor each of the Input scenarios, most assumption values have been provided, but one or two from each \nscenario will need to be solved for to find the optimal value, subject to the other values provided. \nThe values that may need to be solved for are: \n• First Debt Repayment Date\n• Sculpted DSCR\n• Debt Drawdown amount\n• Equity Investment amount\n• Required Rate of Return (also known as the Equity IRR)\nYour task will be to build the necessary additions to the model so that it can identify the Optimal missing \nvalues for the selected scenario. \nFor the 1st and 2nd dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If solving for First repayment date, the latest possible date; or\nii) If solving for the Sculpted DSCR, the largest possible DSCR\nThat still allows the debt to be repaid by the Latest allowed Debt Maturity Date, without the DSCR ever \nfalling below the Sculpted DSCR value in any given quarter. \n \nFor the 3rd, 4th and 5th dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If not provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Equity IRR, which\nwill then become the Required Rate of Return \nii) If provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Purchase Price whilst\nensuring that the Equity IRR is not less than the Required Rate of Return. \nBuild your model adhering to the included Details, and then answer the Questions. \nFurther conditions (“Requirements of a Solved Model”) are listed at the bottom of the Inputs worksheet. \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 20 are based on the provided input scenarios. \nQuestions 21 to 23 may require you to change some of the existing user-variable input values from certain \nscenarios in order to answer. \n \nPrecision of Answers: \nIf submitting a dollar value, give your answer rounded to the nearest thousand dollar  \n(i.e. 0 decimal places when working in units of [$’000] ). There is no need to write “k” or “,000” at the end. \nIf submitting a DSCR value, give your answer to 3 decimal places \nIf submitting a percentage rate, give your answer as a percentage to 3 decimal places (e.g. 11.543%) \nIf submitting a date, give your answer rounded to the nearest day. (That’s a joke…) \n\nDETAILS \n1. Purchase Date Cash Flows \nOn the Purchase Date, the debt facility is drawn with a single drawdown and a single equity \ninvestment is made (there are no other equity investments at any time).  The sum of these two \namounts equals the Purchase Price which immediately goes to the State.  In other words, net cash \nflow for the Purchase Date is zero. \n2. Interest Calculations \nInterest is calculated on the last day of each quarter as  \n(Opening Balance in Quarter) * (Rate % p.a.) * (Days in Qtr) / 365 \nThis applies to both the interest owed on the Debt, and the interest earned / (owed) on any positive / \n(negative) cash account balance. \n3. Refinancing Calculations \nThe debt is refinanced at three points throughout the term.  The refinanced amount is the outstanding \ndebt balance immediately after principal repayment on the refinancing date. A fee is charged on the \nrefinanced amount, and this fee is capitalised into the debt balance.  For clarity, there is no fee \npayable on the fee itself.  The fee is only charged on the old balance that is being refinanced. \n4. Debt Interest Payments \nInterest owed is always paid in full at the end of each quarter for the entire life of the debt facility. \n5. Debt Principal Repayments \nDebt is repaid on the last day of each quarter, commencing on the First Debt Repayment Date, \ncontinuing every quarter until the facility is fully repaid.  All debt must be paid off on or before the \nLatest Allowed Debt Maturity Date.  The amount of each repayment must be sculpted so that the \nDSCR is constant for all quarters during the repayment term.  The only exception to this is the final \nrepayment quarter, which can have a higher DSCR.  The repayment amount in any quarter cannot \nexceed the quarterly opening balance of the facility.  Redraws are not permitted. \n6. DSCR \nThe DSCR is defined only for quarters where the principal repayment amount is not zero.  It is equal \neach quarter to the quarterly value of CFADS / (Net Interest Expense + Principal Repayments) \n7. CFADS \nCFADS (Cash Flow Available for Debt Service) is provided by the ‘Operations’ worksheet for each \nquarter.  For clarity, the definition of CFADS does not include any carryover opening balance. \nHint:  Assumptions have been set so that CFADS will be relatively smooth and healthy, and will \nalways be at least as large as Net Interest Expense * Sculpted DSCR \n8. Net Interest Expense \nDefined as: For each quarter, interest owed on Debt plus interest owed on cash account overdraft \nbalance (if any) less interest earned on cash account positive balance (if any).  \n9. Cash Flow Waterfall \nThe Cash Flow Waterfall should include only the following items: \n(1) CFADS; (2) Interest Revenue/(Overdraft Expense) on Cash Balance; (3) Interest Expense \non Debt; (4) Principal Repayments; (5) Equity Distributions \nAll cashflows are assumed to occur on the final day of each quarter. \n10. Equity Distributions \nDistributions occur on the last day of each quarter every June during the Asset life, and at the Asset \nExpiration Date.  All available cash (including the carry over opening balance) is distributed each \ndistribution date, so long as the cash balance is positive immediately prior to distributions. \n11. Equity IRR \nThe Equity IRR should be calculated using the XIRR function, and consider the cashflows to/from \nequity between the Purchase Date and the Asset Expiration Date inclusive. \n \n\nQuestion 7 For Scenario 4, what is the \nSculpted DSCR

You have been provided the outline of a \nfinancing model which includes 10 scenarios of Inputs, and 10 scenarios of Operating Cash Flow taken \nfrom a colleague’s forecast operations model. \nFor each of the Input scenarios, most assumption values have been provided, but one or two from each \nscenario will need to be solved for to find the optimal value, subject to the other values provided. \nThe values that may need to be solved for are: \n• First Debt Repayment Date\n• Sculpted DSCR\n• Debt Drawdown amount\n• Equity Investment amount\n• Required Rate of Return (also known as the Equity IRR)\nYour task will be to build the necessary additions to the model so that it can identify the Optimal missing \nvalues for the selected scenario. \nFor the 1st and 2nd dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If solving for First repayment date, the latest possible date; or\nii) If solving for the Sculpted DSCR, the largest possible DSCR\nThat still allows the debt to be repaid by the Latest allowed Debt Maturity Date, without the DSCR ever \nfalling below the Sculpted DSCR value in any given quarter. \n \nFor the 3rd, 4th and 5th dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If not provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Equity IRR, which\nwill then become the Required Rate of Return \nii) If provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Purchase Price whilst\nensuring that the Equity IRR is not less than the Required Rate of Return. \nBuild your model adhering to the included Details, and then answer the Questions. \nFurther conditions (“Requirements of a Solved Model”) are listed at the bottom of the Inputs worksheet. \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 20 are based on the provided input scenarios. \nQuestions 21 to 23 may require you to change some of the existing user-variable input values from certain \nscenarios in order to answer. \n \nPrecision of Answers: \nIf submitting a dollar value, give your answer rounded to the nearest thousand dollar  \n(i.e. 0 decimal places when working in units of [$’000] ). There is no need to write “k” or “,000” at the end. \nIf submitting a DSCR value, give your answer to 3 decimal places \nIf submitting a percentage rate, give your answer as a percentage to 3 decimal places (e.g. 11.543%) \nIf submitting a date, give your answer rounded to the nearest day. (That’s a joke…) \n\nDETAILS \n1. Purchase Date Cash Flows \nOn the Purchase Date, the debt facility is drawn with a single drawdown and a single equity \ninvestment is made (there are no other equity investments at any time).  The sum of these two \namounts equals the Purchase Price which immediately goes to the State.  In other words, net cash \nflow for the Purchase Date is zero. \n2. Interest Calculations \nInterest is calculated on the last day of each quarter as  \n(Opening Balance in Quarter) * (Rate % p.a.) * (Days in Qtr) / 365 \nThis applies to both the interest owed on the Debt, and the interest earned / (owed) on any positive / \n(negative) cash account balance. \n3. Refinancing Calculations \nThe debt is refinanced at three points throughout the term.  The refinanced amount is the outstanding \ndebt balance immediately after principal repayment on the refinancing date. A fee is charged on the \nrefinanced amount, and this fee is capitalised into the debt balance.  For clarity, there is no fee \npayable on the fee itself.  The fee is only charged on the old balance that is being refinanced. \n4. Debt Interest Payments \nInterest owed is always paid in full at the end of each quarter for the entire life of the debt facility. \n5. Debt Principal Repayments \nDebt is repaid on the last day of each quarter, commencing on the First Debt Repayment Date, \ncontinuing every quarter until the facility is fully repaid.  All debt must be paid off on or before the \nLatest Allowed Debt Maturity Date.  The amount of each repayment must be sculpted so that the \nDSCR is constant for all quarters during the repayment term.  The only exception to this is the final \nrepayment quarter, which can have a higher DSCR.  The repayment amount in any quarter cannot \nexceed the quarterly opening balance of the facility.  Redraws are not permitted. \n6. DSCR \nThe DSCR is defined only for quarters where the principal repayment amount is not zero.  It is equal \neach quarter to the quarterly value of CFADS / (Net Interest Expense + Principal Repayments) \n7. CFADS \nCFADS (Cash Flow Available for Debt Service) is provided by the ‘Operations’ worksheet for each \nquarter.  For clarity, the definition of CFADS does not include any carryover opening balance. \nHint:  Assumptions have been set so that CFADS will be relatively smooth and healthy, and will \nalways be at least as large as Net Interest Expense * Sculpted DSCR \n8. Net Interest Expense \nDefined as: For each quarter, interest owed on Debt plus interest owed on cash account overdraft \nbalance (if any) less interest earned on cash account positive balance (if any).  \n9. Cash Flow Waterfall \nThe Cash Flow Waterfall should include only the following items: \n(1) CFADS; (2) Interest Revenue/(Overdraft Expense) on Cash Balance; (3) Interest Expense \non Debt; (4) Principal Repayments; (5) Equity Distributions \nAll cashflows are assumed to occur on the final day of each quarter. \n10. Equity Distributions \nDistributions occur on the last day of each quarter every June during the Asset life, and at the Asset \nExpiration Date.  All available cash (including the carry over opening balance) is distributed each \ndistribution date, so long as the cash balance is positive immediately prior to distributions. \n11. Equity IRR \nThe Equity IRR should be calculated using the XIRR function, and consider the cashflows to/from \nequity between the Purchase Date and the Asset Expiration Date inclusive. \n \n\nQuestion 9 For Scenario 5, what is the \nFirst Repayment Date

You have been provided the outline of a \nfinancing model which includes 10 scenarios of Inputs, and 10 scenarios of Operating Cash Flow taken \nfrom a colleague’s forecast operations model. \nFor each of the Input scenarios, most assumption values have been provided, but one or two from each \nscenario will need to be solved for to find the optimal value, subject to the other values provided. \nThe values that may need to be solved for are: \n• First Debt Repayment Date\n• Sculpted DSCR\n• Debt Drawdown amount\n• Equity Investment amount\n• Required Rate of Return (also known as the Equity IRR)\nYour task will be to build the necessary additions to the model so that it can identify the Optimal missing \nvalues for the selected scenario. \nFor the 1st and 2nd dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If solving for First repayment date, the latest possible date; or\nii) If solving for the Sculpted DSCR, the largest possible DSCR\nThat still allows the debt to be repaid by the Latest allowed Debt Maturity Date, without the DSCR ever \nfalling below the Sculpted DSCR value in any given quarter. \n \nFor the 3rd, 4th and 5th dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If not provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Equity IRR, which\nwill then become the Required Rate of Return \nii) If provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Purchase Price whilst\nensuring that the Equity IRR is not less than the Required Rate of Return. \nBuild your model adhering to the included Details, and then answer the Questions. \nFurther conditions (“Requirements of a Solved Model”) are listed at the bottom of the Inputs worksheet. \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 20 are based on the provided input scenarios. \nQuestions 21 to 23 may require you to change some of the existing user-variable input values from certain \nscenarios in order to answer. \n \nPrecision of Answers: \nIf submitting a dollar value, give your answer rounded to the nearest thousand dollar  \n(i.e. 0 decimal places when working in units of [$’000] ). There is no need to write “k” or “,000” at the end. \nIf submitting a DSCR value, give your answer to 3 decimal places \nIf submitting a percentage rate, give your answer as a percentage to 3 decimal places (e.g. 11.543%) \nIf submitting a date, give your answer rounded to the nearest day. (That’s a joke…) \n\nDETAILS \n1. Purchase Date Cash Flows \nOn the Purchase Date, the debt facility is drawn with a single drawdown and a single equity \ninvestment is made (there are no other equity investments at any time).  The sum of these two \namounts equals the Purchase Price which immediately goes to the State.  In other words, net cash \nflow for the Purchase Date is zero. \n2. Interest Calculations \nInterest is calculated on the last day of each quarter as  \n(Opening Balance in Quarter) * (Rate % p.a.) * (Days in Qtr) / 365 \nThis applies to both the interest owed on the Debt, and the interest earned / (owed) on any positive / \n(negative) cash account balance. \n3. Refinancing Calculations \nThe debt is refinanced at three points throughout the term.  The refinanced amount is the outstanding \ndebt balance immediately after principal repayment on the refinancing date. A fee is charged on the \nrefinanced amount, and this fee is capitalised into the debt balance.  For clarity, there is no fee \npayable on the fee itself.  The fee is only charged on the old balance that is being refinanced. \n4. Debt Interest Payments \nInterest owed is always paid in full at the end of each quarter for the entire life of the debt facility. \n5. Debt Principal Repayments \nDebt is repaid on the last day of each quarter, commencing on the First Debt Repayment Date, \ncontinuing every quarter until the facility is fully repaid.  All debt must be paid off on or before the \nLatest Allowed Debt Maturity Date.  The amount of each repayment must be sculpted so that the \nDSCR is constant for all quarters during the repayment term.  The only exception to this is the final \nrepayment quarter, which can have a higher DSCR.  The repayment amount in any quarter cannot \nexceed the quarterly opening balance of the facility.  Redraws are not permitted. \n6. DSCR \nThe DSCR is defined only for quarters where the principal repayment amount is not zero.  It is equal \neach quarter to the quarterly value of CFADS / (Net Interest Expense + Principal Repayments) \n7. CFADS \nCFADS (Cash Flow Available for Debt Service) is provided by the ‘Operations’ worksheet for each \nquarter.  For clarity, the definition of CFADS does not include any carryover opening balance. \nHint:  Assumptions have been set so that CFADS will be relatively smooth and healthy, and will \nalways be at least as large as Net Interest Expense * Sculpted DSCR \n8. Net Interest Expense \nDefined as: For each quarter, interest owed on Debt plus interest owed on cash account overdraft \nbalance (if any) less interest earned on cash account positive balance (if any).  \n9. Cash Flow Waterfall \nThe Cash Flow Waterfall should include only the following items: \n(1) CFADS; (2) Interest Revenue/(Overdraft Expense) on Cash Balance; (3) Interest Expense \non Debt; (4) Principal Repayments; (5) Equity Distributions \nAll cashflows are assumed to occur on the final day of each quarter. \n10. Equity Distributions \nDistributions occur on the last day of each quarter every June during the Asset life, and at the Asset \nExpiration Date.  All available cash (including the carry over opening balance) is distributed each \ndistribution date, so long as the cash balance is positive immediately prior to distributions. \n11. Equity IRR \nThe Equity IRR should be calculated using the XIRR function, and consider the cashflows to/from \nequity between the Purchase Date and the Asset Expiration Date inclusive. \n \n\nQuestion 11 For Scenario 6, what is the \nSculpted DSCR

You have been provided the outline of a \nfinancing model which includes 10 scenarios of Inputs, and 10 scenarios of Operating Cash Flow taken \nfrom a colleague’s forecast operations model. \nFor each of the Input scenarios, most assumption values have been provided, but one or two from each \nscenario will need to be solved for to find the optimal value, subject to the other values provided. \nThe values that may need to be solved for are: \n• First Debt Repayment Date\n• Sculpted DSCR\n• Debt Drawdown amount\n• Equity Investment amount\n• Required Rate of Return (also known as the Equity IRR)\nYour task will be to build the necessary additions to the model so that it can identify the Optimal missing \nvalues for the selected scenario. \nFor the 1st and 2nd dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If solving for First repayment date, the latest possible date; or\nii) If solving for the Sculpted DSCR, the largest possible DSCR\nThat still allows the debt to be repaid by the Latest allowed Debt Maturity Date, without the DSCR ever \nfalling below the Sculpted DSCR value in any given quarter. \n \nFor the 3rd, 4th and 5th dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If not provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Equity IRR, which\nwill then become the Required Rate of Return \nii) If provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Purchase Price whilst\nensuring that the Equity IRR is not less than the Required Rate of Return. \nBuild your model adhering to the included Details, and then answer the Questions. \nFurther conditions (“Requirements of a Solved Model”) are listed at the bottom of the Inputs worksheet. \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 20 are based on the provided input scenarios. \nQuestions 21 to 23 may require you to change some of the existing user-variable input values from certain \nscenarios in order to answer. \n \nPrecision of Answers: \nIf submitting a dollar value, give your answer rounded to the nearest thousand dollar  \n(i.e. 0 decimal places when working in units of [$’000] ). There is no need to write “k” or “,000” at the end. \nIf submitting a DSCR value, give your answer to 3 decimal places \nIf submitting a percentage rate, give your answer as a percentage to 3 decimal places (e.g. 11.543%) \nIf submitting a date, give your answer rounded to the nearest day. (That’s a joke…) \n\nDETAILS \n1. Purchase Date Cash Flows \nOn the Purchase Date, the debt facility is drawn with a single drawdown and a single equity \ninvestment is made (there are no other equity investments at any time).  The sum of these two \namounts equals the Purchase Price which immediately goes to the State.  In other words, net cash \nflow for the Purchase Date is zero. \n2. Interest Calculations \nInterest is calculated on the last day of each quarter as  \n(Opening Balance in Quarter) * (Rate % p.a.) * (Days in Qtr) / 365 \nThis applies to both the interest owed on the Debt, and the interest earned / (owed) on any positive / \n(negative) cash account balance. \n3. Refinancing Calculations \nThe debt is refinanced at three points throughout the term.  The refinanced amount is the outstanding \ndebt balance immediately after principal repayment on the refinancing date. A fee is charged on the \nrefinanced amount, and this fee is capitalised into the debt balance.  For clarity, there is no fee \npayable on the fee itself.  The fee is only charged on the old balance that is being refinanced. \n4. Debt Interest Payments \nInterest owed is always paid in full at the end of each quarter for the entire life of the debt facility. \n5. Debt Principal Repayments \nDebt is repaid on the last day of each quarter, commencing on the First Debt Repayment Date, \ncontinuing every quarter until the facility is fully repaid.  All debt must be paid off on or before the \nLatest Allowed Debt Maturity Date.  The amount of each repayment must be sculpted so that the \nDSCR is constant for all quarters during the repayment term.  The only exception to this is the final \nrepayment quarter, which can have a higher DSCR.  The repayment amount in any quarter cannot \nexceed the quarterly opening balance of the facility.  Redraws are not permitted. \n6. DSCR \nThe DSCR is defined only for quarters where the principal repayment amount is not zero.  It is equal \neach quarter to the quarterly value of CFADS / (Net Interest Expense + Principal Repayments) \n7. CFADS \nCFADS (Cash Flow Available for Debt Service) is provided by the ‘Operations’ worksheet for each \nquarter.  For clarity, the definition of CFADS does not include any carryover opening balance. \nHint:  Assumptions have been set so that CFADS will be relatively smooth and healthy, and will \nalways be at least as large as Net Interest Expense * Sculpted DSCR \n8. Net Interest Expense \nDefined as: For each quarter, interest owed on Debt plus interest owed on cash account overdraft \nbalance (if any) less interest earned on cash account positive balance (if any).  \n9. Cash Flow Waterfall \nThe Cash Flow Waterfall should include only the following items: \n(1) CFADS; (2) Interest Revenue/(Overdraft Expense) on Cash Balance; (3) Interest Expense \non Debt; (4) Principal Repayments; (5) Equity Distributions \nAll cashflows are assumed to occur on the final day of each quarter. \n10. Equity Distributions \nDistributions occur on the last day of each quarter every June during the Asset life, and at the Asset \nExpiration Date.  All available cash (including the carry over opening balance) is distributed each \ndistribution date, so long as the cash balance is positive immediately prior to distributions. \n11. Equity IRR \nThe Equity IRR should be calculated using the XIRR function, and consider the cashflows to/from \nequity between the Purchase Date and the Asset Expiration Date inclusive. \n \n\nQuestion 13 For Scenario 7, what is the \nFirst Repayment Date

You have been provided the outline of a \nfinancing model which includes 10 scenarios of Inputs, and 10 scenarios of Operating Cash Flow taken \nfrom a colleague’s forecast operations model. \nFor each of the Input scenarios, most assumption values have been provided, but one or two from each \nscenario will need to be solved for to find the optimal value, subject to the other values provided. \nThe values that may need to be solved for are: \n• First Debt Repayment Date\n• Sculpted DSCR\n• Debt Drawdown amount\n• Equity Investment amount\n• Required Rate of Return (also known as the Equity IRR)\nYour task will be to build the necessary additions to the model so that it can identify the Optimal missing \nvalues for the selected scenario. \nFor the 1st and 2nd dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If solving for First repayment date, the latest possible date; or\nii) If solving for the Sculpted DSCR, the largest possible DSCR\nThat still allows the debt to be repaid by the Latest allowed Debt Maturity Date, without the DSCR ever \nfalling below the Sculpted DSCR value in any given quarter. \n \nFor the 3rd, 4th and 5th dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If not provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Equity IRR, which\nwill then become the Required Rate of Return \nii) If provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Purchase Price whilst\nensuring that the Equity IRR is not less than the Required Rate of Return. \nBuild your model adhering to the included Details, and then answer the Questions. \nFurther conditions (“Requirements of a Solved Model”) are listed at the bottom of the Inputs worksheet. \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 20 are based on the provided input scenarios. \nQuestions 21 to 23 may require you to change some of the existing user-variable input values from certain \nscenarios in order to answer. \n \nPrecision of Answers: \nIf submitting a dollar value, give your answer rounded to the nearest thousand dollar  \n(i.e. 0 decimal places when working in units of [$’000] ). There is no need to write “k” or “,000” at the end. \nIf submitting a DSCR value, give your answer to 3 decimal places \nIf submitting a percentage rate, give your answer as a percentage to 3 decimal places (e.g. 11.543%) \nIf submitting a date, give your answer rounded to the nearest day. (That’s a joke…) \n\nDETAILS \n1. Purchase Date Cash Flows \nOn the Purchase Date, the debt facility is drawn with a single drawdown and a single equity \ninvestment is made (there are no other equity investments at any time).  The sum of these two \namounts equals the Purchase Price which immediately goes to the State.  In other words, net cash \nflow for the Purchase Date is zero. \n2. Interest Calculations \nInterest is calculated on the last day of each quarter as  \n(Opening Balance in Quarter) * (Rate % p.a.) * (Days in Qtr) / 365 \nThis applies to both the interest owed on the Debt, and the interest earned / (owed) on any positive / \n(negative) cash account balance. \n3. Refinancing Calculations \nThe debt is refinanced at three points throughout the term.  The refinanced amount is the outstanding \ndebt balance immediately after principal repayment on the refinancing date. A fee is charged on the \nrefinanced amount, and this fee is capitalised into the debt balance.  For clarity, there is no fee \npayable on the fee itself.  The fee is only charged on the old balance that is being refinanced. \n4. Debt Interest Payments \nInterest owed is always paid in full at the end of each quarter for the entire life of the debt facility. \n5. Debt Principal Repayments \nDebt is repaid on the last day of each quarter, commencing on the First Debt Repayment Date, \ncontinuing every quarter until the facility is fully repaid.  All debt must be paid off on or before the \nLatest Allowed Debt Maturity Date.  The amount of each repayment must be sculpted so that the \nDSCR is constant for all quarters during the repayment term.  The only exception to this is the final \nrepayment quarter, which can have a higher DSCR.  The repayment amount in any quarter cannot \nexceed the quarterly opening balance of the facility.  Redraws are not permitted. \n6. DSCR \nThe DSCR is defined only for quarters where the principal repayment amount is not zero.  It is equal \neach quarter to the quarterly value of CFADS / (Net Interest Expense + Principal Repayments) \n7. CFADS \nCFADS (Cash Flow Available for Debt Service) is provided by the ‘Operations’ worksheet for each \nquarter.  For clarity, the definition of CFADS does not include any carryover opening balance. \nHint:  Assumptions have been set so that CFADS will be relatively smooth and healthy, and will \nalways be at least as large as Net Interest Expense * Sculpted DSCR \n8. Net Interest Expense \nDefined as: For each quarter, interest owed on Debt plus interest owed on cash account overdraft \nbalance (if any) less interest earned on cash account positive balance (if any).  \n9. Cash Flow Waterfall \nThe Cash Flow Waterfall should include only the following items: \n(1) CFADS; (2) Interest Revenue/(Overdraft Expense) on Cash Balance; (3) Interest Expense \non Debt; (4) Principal Repayments; (5) Equity Distributions \nAll cashflows are assumed to occur on the final day of each quarter. \n10. Equity Distributions \nDistributions occur on the last day of each quarter every June during the Asset life, and at the Asset \nExpiration Date.  All available cash (including the carry over opening balance) is distributed each \ndistribution date, so long as the cash balance is positive immediately prior to distributions. \n11. Equity IRR \nThe Equity IRR should be calculated using the XIRR function, and consider the cashflows to/from \nequity between the Purchase Date and the Asset Expiration Date inclusive. \n \n\nQuestion 15 For Scenario 8, what is the \nSculpted DSCR

You have been provided the outline of a \nfinancing model which includes 10 scenarios of Inputs, and 10 scenarios of Operating Cash Flow taken \nfrom a colleague’s forecast operations model. \nFor each of the Input scenarios, most assumption values have been provided, but one or two from each \nscenario will need to be solved for to find the optimal value, subject to the other values provided. \nThe values that may need to be solved for are: \n• First Debt Repayment Date\n• Sculpted DSCR\n• Debt Drawdown amount\n• Equity Investment amount\n• Required Rate of Return (also known as the Equity IRR)\nYour task will be to build the necessary additions to the model so that it can identify the Optimal missing \nvalues for the selected scenario. \nFor the 1st and 2nd dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If solving for First repayment date, the latest possible date; or\nii) If solving for the Sculpted DSCR, the largest possible DSCR\nThat still allows the debt to be repaid by the Latest allowed Debt Maturity Date, without the DSCR ever \nfalling below the Sculpted DSCR value in any given quarter. \n \nFor the 3rd, 4th and 5th dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If not provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Equity IRR, which\nwill then become the Required Rate of Return \nii) If provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Purchase Price whilst\nensuring that the Equity IRR is not less than the Required Rate of Return. \nBuild your model adhering to the included Details, and then answer the Questions. \nFurther conditions (“Requirements of a Solved Model”) are listed at the bottom of the Inputs worksheet. \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 20 are based on the provided input scenarios. \nQuestions 21 to 23 may require you to change some of the existing user-variable input values from certain \nscenarios in order to answer. \n \nPrecision of Answers: \nIf submitting a dollar value, give your answer rounded to the nearest thousand dollar  \n(i.e. 0 decimal places when working in units of [$’000] ). There is no need to write “k” or “,000” at the end. \nIf submitting a DSCR value, give your answer to 3 decimal places \nIf submitting a percentage rate, give your answer as a percentage to 3 decimal places (e.g. 11.543%) \nIf submitting a date, give your answer rounded to the nearest day. (That’s a joke…) \n\nDETAILS \n1. Purchase Date Cash Flows \nOn the Purchase Date, the debt facility is drawn with a single drawdown and a single equity \ninvestment is made (there are no other equity investments at any time).  The sum of these two \namounts equals the Purchase Price which immediately goes to the State.  In other words, net cash \nflow for the Purchase Date is zero. \n2. Interest Calculations \nInterest is calculated on the last day of each quarter as  \n(Opening Balance in Quarter) * (Rate % p.a.) * (Days in Qtr) / 365 \nThis applies to both the interest owed on the Debt, and the interest earned / (owed) on any positive / \n(negative) cash account balance. \n3. Refinancing Calculations \nThe debt is refinanced at three points throughout the term.  The refinanced amount is the outstanding \ndebt balance immediately after principal repayment on the refinancing date. A fee is charged on the \nrefinanced amount, and this fee is capitalised into the debt balance.  For clarity, there is no fee \npayable on the fee itself.  The fee is only charged on the old balance that is being refinanced. \n4. Debt Interest Payments \nInterest owed is always paid in full at the end of each quarter for the entire life of the debt facility. \n5. Debt Principal Repayments \nDebt is repaid on the last day of each quarter, commencing on the First Debt Repayment Date, \ncontinuing every quarter until the facility is fully repaid.  All debt must be paid off on or before the \nLatest Allowed Debt Maturity Date.  The amount of each repayment must be sculpted so that the \nDSCR is constant for all quarters during the repayment term.  The only exception to this is the final \nrepayment quarter, which can have a higher DSCR.  The repayment amount in any quarter cannot \nexceed the quarterly opening balance of the facility.  Redraws are not permitted. \n6. DSCR \nThe DSCR is defined only for quarters where the principal repayment amount is not zero.  It is equal \neach quarter to the quarterly value of CFADS / (Net Interest Expense + Principal Repayments) \n7. CFADS \nCFADS (Cash Flow Available for Debt Service) is provided by the ‘Operations’ worksheet for each \nquarter.  For clarity, the definition of CFADS does not include any carryover opening balance. \nHint:  Assumptions have been set so that CFADS will be relatively smooth and healthy, and will \nalways be at least as large as Net Interest Expense * Sculpted DSCR \n8. Net Interest Expense \nDefined as: For each quarter, interest owed on Debt plus interest owed on cash account overdraft \nbalance (if any) less interest earned on cash account positive balance (if any).  \n9. Cash Flow Waterfall \nThe Cash Flow Waterfall should include only the following items: \n(1) CFADS; (2) Interest Revenue/(Overdraft Expense) on Cash Balance; (3) Interest Expense \non Debt; (4) Principal Repayments; (5) Equity Distributions \nAll cashflows are assumed to occur on the final day of each quarter. \n10. Equity Distributions \nDistributions occur on the last day of each quarter every June during the Asset life, and at the Asset \nExpiration Date.  All available cash (including the carry over opening balance) is distributed each \ndistribution date, so long as the cash balance is positive immediately prior to distributions. \n11. Equity IRR \nThe Equity IRR should be calculated using the XIRR function, and consider the cashflows to/from \nequity between the Purchase Date and the Asset Expiration Date inclusive. \n \n\nQuestion 17 For Scenario 9, what is the \nSculpted DSCR

You have been provided the outline of a \nfinancing model which includes 10 scenarios of Inputs, and 10 scenarios of Operating Cash Flow taken \nfrom a colleague’s forecast operations model. \nFor each of the Input scenarios, most assumption values have been provided, but one or two from each \nscenario will need to be solved for to find the optimal value, subject to the other values provided. \nThe values that may need to be solved for are: \n• First Debt Repayment Date\n• Sculpted DSCR\n• Debt Drawdown amount\n• Equity Investment amount\n• Required Rate of Return (also known as the Equity IRR)\nYour task will be to build the necessary additions to the model so that it can identify the Optimal missing \nvalues for the selected scenario. \nFor the 1st and 2nd dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If solving for First repayment date, the latest possible date; or\nii) If solving for the Sculpted DSCR, the largest possible DSCR\nThat still allows the debt to be repaid by the Latest allowed Debt Maturity Date, without the DSCR ever \nfalling below the Sculpted DSCR value in any given quarter. \n \nFor the 3rd, 4th and 5th dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If not provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Equity IRR, which\nwill then become the Required Rate of Return \nii) If provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Purchase Price whilst\nensuring that the Equity IRR is not less than the Required Rate of Return. \nBuild your model adhering to the included Details, and then answer the Questions. \nFurther conditions (“Requirements of a Solved Model”) are listed at the bottom of the Inputs worksheet. \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 20 are based on the provided input scenarios. \nQuestions 21 to 23 may require you to change some of the existing user-variable input values from certain \nscenarios in order to answer. \n \nPrecision of Answers: \nIf submitting a dollar value, give your answer rounded to the nearest thousand dollar  \n(i.e. 0 decimal places when working in units of [$’000] ). There is no need to write “k” or “,000” at the end. \nIf submitting a DSCR value, give your answer to 3 decimal places \nIf submitting a percentage rate, give your answer as a percentage to 3 decimal places (e.g. 11.543%) \nIf submitting a date, give your answer rounded to the nearest day. (That’s a joke…) \n\nDETAILS \n1. Purchase Date Cash Flows \nOn the Purchase Date, the debt facility is drawn with a single drawdown and a single equity \ninvestment is made (there are no other equity investments at any time).  The sum of these two \namounts equals the Purchase Price which immediately goes to the State.  In other words, net cash \nflow for the Purchase Date is zero. \n2. Interest Calculations \nInterest is calculated on the last day of each quarter as  \n(Opening Balance in Quarter) * (Rate % p.a.) * (Days in Qtr) / 365 \nThis applies to both the interest owed on the Debt, and the interest earned / (owed) on any positive / \n(negative) cash account balance. \n3. Refinancing Calculations \nThe debt is refinanced at three points throughout the term.  The refinanced amount is the outstanding \ndebt balance immediately after principal repayment on the refinancing date. A fee is charged on the \nrefinanced amount, and this fee is capitalised into the debt balance.  For clarity, there is no fee \npayable on the fee itself.  The fee is only charged on the old balance that is being refinanced. \n4. Debt Interest Payments \nInterest owed is always paid in full at the end of each quarter for the entire life of the debt facility. \n5. Debt Principal Repayments \nDebt is repaid on the last day of each quarter, commencing on the First Debt Repayment Date, \ncontinuing every quarter until the facility is fully repaid.  All debt must be paid off on or before the \nLatest Allowed Debt Maturity Date.  The amount of each repayment must be sculpted so that the \nDSCR is constant for all quarters during the repayment term.  The only exception to this is the final \nrepayment quarter, which can have a higher DSCR.  The repayment amount in any quarter cannot \nexceed the quarterly opening balance of the facility.  Redraws are not permitted. \n6. DSCR \nThe DSCR is defined only for quarters where the principal repayment amount is not zero.  It is equal \neach quarter to the quarterly value of CFADS / (Net Interest Expense + Principal Repayments) \n7. CFADS \nCFADS (Cash Flow Available for Debt Service) is provided by the ‘Operations’ worksheet for each \nquarter.  For clarity, the definition of CFADS does not include any carryover opening balance. \nHint:  Assumptions have been set so that CFADS will be relatively smooth and healthy, and will \nalways be at least as large as Net Interest Expense * Sculpted DSCR \n8. Net Interest Expense \nDefined as: For each quarter, interest owed on Debt plus interest owed on cash account overdraft \nbalance (if any) less interest earned on cash account positive balance (if any).  \n9. Cash Flow Waterfall \nThe Cash Flow Waterfall should include only the following items: \n(1) CFADS; (2) Interest Revenue/(Overdraft Expense) on Cash Balance; (3) Interest Expense \non Debt; (4) Principal Repayments; (5) Equity Distributions \nAll cashflows are assumed to occur on the final day of each quarter. \n10. Equity Distributions \nDistributions occur on the last day of each quarter every June during the Asset life, and at the Asset \nExpiration Date.  All available cash (including the carry over opening balance) is distributed each \ndistribution date, so long as the cash balance is positive immediately prior to distributions. \n11. Equity IRR \nThe Equity IRR should be calculated using the XIRR function, and consider the cashflows to/from \nequity between the Purchase Date and the Asset Expiration Date inclusive. \n \n\nQuestion 19 For Scenario 10, what is the \nDebt Drawdown amount

You have been provided the outline of a \nfinancing model which includes 10 scenarios of Inputs, and 10 scenarios of Operating Cash Flow taken \nfrom a colleague’s forecast operations model. \nFor each of the Input scenarios, most assumption values have been provided, but one or two from each \nscenario will need to be solved for to find the optimal value, subject to the other values provided. \nThe values that may need to be solved for are: \n• First Debt Repayment Date\n• Sculpted DSCR\n• Debt Drawdown amount\n• Equity Investment amount\n• Required Rate of Return (also known as the Equity IRR)\nYour task will be to build the necessary additions to the model so that it can identify the Optimal missing \nvalues for the selected scenario. \nFor the 1st and 2nd dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If solving for First repayment date, the latest possible date; or\nii) If solving for the Sculpted DSCR, the largest possible DSCR\nThat still allows the debt to be repaid by the Latest allowed Debt Maturity Date, without the DSCR ever \nfalling below the Sculpted DSCR value in any given quarter. \n \nFor the 3rd, 4th and 5th dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If not provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Equity IRR, which\nwill then become the Required Rate of Return \nii) If provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Purchase Price whilst\nensuring that the Equity IRR is not less than the Required Rate of Return. \nBuild your model adhering to the included Details, and then answer the Questions. \nFurther conditions (“Requirements of a Solved Model”) are listed at the bottom of the Inputs worksheet. \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 20 are based on the provided input scenarios. \nQuestions 21 to 23 may require you to change some of the existing user-variable input values from certain \nscenarios in order to answer. \n \nPrecision of Answers: \nIf submitting a dollar value, give your answer rounded to the nearest thousand dollar  \n(i.e. 0 decimal places when working in units of [$’000] ). There is no need to write “k” or “,000” at the end. \nIf submitting a DSCR value, give your answer to 3 decimal places \nIf submitting a percentage rate, give your answer as a percentage to 3 decimal places (e.g. 11.543%) \nIf submitting a date, give your answer rounded to the nearest day. (That’s a joke…) \n\nDETAILS \n1. Purchase Date Cash Flows \nOn the Purchase Date, the debt facility is drawn with a single drawdown and a single equity \ninvestment is made (there are no other equity investments at any time).  The sum of these two \namounts equals the Purchase Price which immediately goes to the State.  In other words, net cash \nflow for the Purchase Date is zero. \n2. Interest Calculations \nInterest is calculated on the last day of each quarter as  \n(Opening Balance in Quarter) * (Rate % p.a.) * (Days in Qtr) / 365 \nThis applies to both the interest owed on the Debt, and the interest earned / (owed) on any positive / \n(negative) cash account balance. \n3. Refinancing Calculations \nThe debt is refinanced at three points throughout the term.  The refinanced amount is the outstanding \ndebt balance immediately after principal repayment on the refinancing date. A fee is charged on the \nrefinanced amount, and this fee is capitalised into the debt balance.  For clarity, there is no fee \npayable on the fee itself.  The fee is only charged on the old balance that is being refinanced. \n4. Debt Interest Payments \nInterest owed is always paid in full at the end of each quarter for the entire life of the debt facility. \n5. Debt Principal Repayments \nDebt is repaid on the last day of each quarter, commencing on the First Debt Repayment Date, \ncontinuing every quarter until the facility is fully repaid.  All debt must be paid off on or before the \nLatest Allowed Debt Maturity Date.  The amount of each repayment must be sculpted so that the \nDSCR is constant for all quarters during the repayment term.  The only exception to this is the final \nrepayment quarter, which can have a higher DSCR.  The repayment amount in any quarter cannot \nexceed the quarterly opening balance of the facility.  Redraws are not permitted. \n6. DSCR \nThe DSCR is defined only for quarters where the principal repayment amount is not zero.  It is equal \neach quarter to the quarterly value of CFADS / (Net Interest Expense + Principal Repayments) \n7. CFADS \nCFADS (Cash Flow Available for Debt Service) is provided by the ‘Operations’ worksheet for each \nquarter.  For clarity, the definition of CFADS does not include any carryover opening balance. \nHint:  Assumptions have been set so that CFADS will be relatively smooth and healthy, and will \nalways be at least as large as Net Interest Expense * Sculpted DSCR \n8. Net Interest Expense \nDefined as: For each quarter, interest owed on Debt plus interest owed on cash account overdraft \nbalance (if any) less interest earned on cash account positive balance (if any).  \n9. Cash Flow Waterfall \nThe Cash Flow Waterfall should include only the following items: \n(1) CFADS; (2) Interest Revenue/(Overdraft Expense) on Cash Balance; (3) Interest Expense \non Debt; (4) Principal Repayments; (5) Equity Distributions \nAll cashflows are assumed to occur on the final day of each quarter. \n10. Equity Distributions \nDistributions occur on the last day of each quarter every June during the Asset life, and at the Asset \nExpiration Date.  All available cash (including the carry over opening balance) is distributed each \ndistribution date, so long as the cash balance is positive immediately prior to distributions. \n11. Equity IRR \nThe Equity IRR should be calculated using the XIRR function, and consider the cashflows to/from \nequity between the Purchase Date and the Asset Expiration Date inclusive. \n \n\nFor the following questions, you will need to selec t a Scenario, but change the ‘Operating Scenario\nin force’ assumption (‘Inputs’ row 24) for that Sce nario in order to answer the questions.\nFor each of these questions, you will need to get b oth parts correct in order to receive the marks\nfor the question.\n\nQuestion 21 (Free field answer)\nSelect Scenario 5. Which Operating Scenario (1 to 10) leads to the largest optimal Equity \nInvestment for Scenario 5, and what is that Equity Investment Amount?

You have been provided the outline of a \nfinancing model which includes 10 scenarios of Inputs, and 10 scenarios of Operating Cash Flow taken \nfrom a colleague’s forecast operations model. \nFor each of the Input scenarios, most assumption values have been provided, but one or two from each \nscenario will need to be solved for to find the optimal value, subject to the other values provided. \nThe values that may need to be solved for are: \n• First Debt Repayment Date\n• Sculpted DSCR\n• Debt Drawdown amount\n• Equity Investment amount\n• Required Rate of Return (also known as the Equity IRR)\nYour task will be to build the necessary additions to the model so that it can identify the Optimal missing \nvalues for the selected scenario. \nFor the 1st and 2nd dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If solving for First repayment date, the latest possible date; or\nii) If solving for the Sculpted DSCR, the largest possible DSCR\nThat still allows the debt to be repaid by the Latest allowed Debt Maturity Date, without the DSCR ever \nfalling below the Sculpted DSCR value in any given quarter. \n \nFor the 3rd, 4th and 5th dot point items, Optimal values are defined as: \ni) If not provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Equity IRR, which\nwill then become the Required Rate of Return \nii) If provided with the Required Rate of Return, the values that maximise the Purchase Price whilst\nensuring that the Equity IRR is not less than the Required Rate of Return. \nBuild your model adhering to the included Details, and then answer the Questions. \nFurther conditions (“Requirements of a Solved Model”) are listed at the bottom of the Inputs worksheet. \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 20 are based on the provided input scenarios. \nQuestions 21 to 23 may require you to change some of the existing user-variable input values from certain \nscenarios in order to answer. \n \nPrecision of Answers: \nIf submitting a dollar value, give your answer rounded to the nearest thousand dollar  \n(i.e. 0 decimal places when working in units of [$’000] ). There is no need to write “k” or “,000” at the end. \nIf submitting a DSCR value, give your answer to 3 decimal places \nIf submitting a percentage rate, give your answer as a percentage to 3 decimal places (e.g. 11.543%) \nIf submitting a date, give your answer rounded to the nearest day. (That’s a joke…) \n\nDETAILS \n1. Purchase Date Cash Flows \nOn the Purchase Date, the debt facility is drawn with a single drawdown and a single equity \ninvestment is made (there are no other equity investments at any time).  The sum of these two \namounts equals the Purchase Price which immediately goes to the State.  In other words, net cash \nflow for the Purchase Date is zero. \n2. Interest Calculations \nInterest is calculated on the last day of each quarter as  \n(Opening Balance in Quarter) * (Rate % p.a.) * (Days in Qtr) / 365 \nThis applies to both the interest owed on the Debt, and the interest earned / (owed) on any positive / \n(negative) cash account balance. \n3. Refinancing Calculations \nThe debt is refinanced at three points throughout the term.  The refinanced amount is the outstanding \ndebt balance immediately after principal repayment on the refinancing date. A fee is charged on the \nrefinanced amount, and this fee is capitalised into the debt balance.  For clarity, there is no fee \npayable on the fee itself.  The fee is only charged on the old balance that is being refinanced. \n4. Debt Interest Payments \nInterest owed is always paid in full at the end of each quarter for the entire life of the debt facility. \n5. Debt Principal Repayments \nDebt is repaid on the last day of each quarter, commencing on the First Debt Repayment Date, \ncontinuing every quarter until the facility is fully repaid.  All debt must be paid off on or before the \nLatest Allowed Debt Maturity Date.  The amount of each repayment must be sculpted so that the \nDSCR is constant for all quarters during the repayment term.  The only exception to this is the final \nrepayment quarter, which can have a higher DSCR.  The repayment amount in any quarter cannot \nexceed the quarterly opening balance of the facility.  Redraws are not permitted. \n6. DSCR \nThe DSCR is defined only for quarters where the principal repayment amount is not zero.  It is equal \neach quarter to the quarterly value of CFADS / (Net Interest Expense + Principal Repayments) \n7. CFADS \nCFADS (Cash Flow Available for Debt Service) is provided by the ‘Operations’ worksheet for each \nquarter.  For clarity, the definition of CFADS does not include any carryover opening balance. \nHint:  Assumptions have been set so that CFADS will be relatively smooth and healthy, and will \nalways be at least as large as Net Interest Expense * Sculpted DSCR \n8. Net Interest Expense \nDefined as: For each quarter, interest owed on Debt plus interest owed on cash account overdraft \nbalance (if any) less interest earned on cash account positive balance (if any).  \n9. Cash Flow Waterfall \nThe Cash Flow Waterfall should include only the following items: \n(1) CFADS; (2) Interest Revenue/(Overdraft Expense) on Cash Balance; (3) Interest Expense \non Debt; (4) Principal Repayments; (5) Equity Distributions \nAll cashflows are assumed to occur on the final day of each quarter. \n10. Equity Distributions \nDistributions occur on the last day of each quarter every June during the Asset life, and at the Asset \nExpiration Date.  All available cash (including the carry over opening balance) is distributed each \ndistribution date, so long as the cash balance is positive immediately prior to distributions. \n11. Equity IRR \nThe Equity IRR should be calculated using the XIRR function, and consider the cashflows to/from \nequity between the Purchase Date and the Asset Expiration Date inclusive. \n \n\nQuestion 23 (Free field answer) \nSelect Scenario 10. Which Operating Scenario (1 to 10) leads to the 6 th largest Purchase Price for \nScenario 10, and what is that Purchase Price amount ?

MVC have 9 depots (referred to as Depot A to Depot I) which they use to service the vehicles. \nYou are planning for the expected vehicles due next quarter and need to allocate the vehicle intake to the \n9 depots under the allocation methodology that MVC uses. \nMVC earns revenue of $2,000 per vehicle serviced. \nProfit is calculated as revenue less any transportation costs incurred less any penalty costs incurred. \nWhere a vehicle is serviced at a depot other than the one where the customer drops it off, MVC must pay \nthe transport costs associated with getting it to the depot it is serviced at, then back to the original depot \nfor collection. Transport costs are $1.40 per vehicle per mile (part miles are charged pro rata).  \nIf MVC cannot service a vehicle, they must pay a $500 penalty per vehicle. They will pay this penalty in \ntwo situations: \n1) Where there is insufficient capacity within a hub to service a vehicle; and \n2) Where the revenue for a vehicle less the transport costs for that vehicle would be more expensive for \nMVC than not servicing the vehicle and paying the penalty. \nDEPOTS AND HUBS \nThere are 9 depots. The distance between each depot pairing (one way, in miles) is shown in the table \nbelow: \n\n            Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\nDepot A     -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot B     482.00   -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot C     417.00   381.49   -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot D     297.00   681.69   340.00   -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot E     576.00 1,096.43   790.23  362.22   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot F     285.00   853.92   683.40   330.00   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot G     613.00 1,150.65 1,095.05  759.71   577.00   341.00   -        -        -\nDepot H     521.00   791.91   976.13  882.81   993.16   620.00   557.82   -        -\nDepot I     529.43   477.25   819.70  908.42 1,133.92   804.87   913.33   319.66   -\n\n \nThis table is also in the Excel workbook provided. All distances in this table are unique (there are no \nduplicates). \nThe total capacity of each depot is shown in the table below: \n\nDepot        Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\n# Vehicles   2,700    400      100      400      100      400      600      700      900\n\nThe depots are organized into between 1 and 3 hubs under the different the scenarios, as set out below.\n\nALLOCATION METHODOLOGY \nFor legal reasons, allocation must be assessed and performed for each hub in isolation (no cars from one \nhub may be serviced in any other hub). The methodology for allocating vehicles to depots for servicing \nwithin a hub is: \n1) Each vehicle is initially delivered to a certain depot and must be collected from that depot. If MVC \nchooses to transport that vehicle to another depot for servicing, MVC will bear a transportation cost for \nthat vehicle as set out above. \n2) All vehicles are serviced at the depot they arrive, where capacity exists to do so. Where any depot has \nexcess vehicles that cannot be serviced at that depot, vehicles are allocated as per step 3. \n3) Calculate the vehicle that has the shortest trip (and therefore cost) to any other depot with available \ncapacity.

MVC have 9 depots (referred to as Depot A to Depot I) which they use to service the vehicles. \nYou are planning for the expected vehicles due next quarter and need to allocate the vehicle intake to the \n9 depots under the allocation methodology that MVC uses. \nMVC earns revenue of $2,000 per vehicle serviced. \nProfit is calculated as revenue less any transportation costs incurred less any penalty costs incurred. \nWhere a vehicle is serviced at a depot other than the one where the customer drops it off, MVC must pay \nthe transport costs associated with getting it to the depot it is serviced at, then back to the original depot \nfor collection. Transport costs are $1.40 per vehicle per mile (part miles are charged pro rata).  \nIf MVC cannot service a vehicle, they must pay a $500 penalty per vehicle. They will pay this penalty in \ntwo situations: \n1) Where there is insufficient capacity within a hub to service a vehicle; and \n2) Where the revenue for a vehicle less the transport costs for that vehicle would be more expensive for \nMVC than not servicing the vehicle and paying the penalty. \nDEPOTS AND HUBS \nThere are 9 depots. The distance between each depot pairing (one way, in miles) is shown in the table \nbelow: \n\n            Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\nDepot A     -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot B     482.00   -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot C     417.00   381.49   -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot D     297.00   681.69   340.00   -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot E     576.00 1,096.43   790.23  362.22   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot F     285.00   853.92   683.40   330.00   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot G     613.00 1,150.65 1,095.05  759.71   577.00   341.00   -        -        -\nDepot H     521.00   791.91   976.13  882.81   993.16   620.00   557.82   -        -\nDepot I     529.43   477.25   819.70  908.42 1,133.92   804.87   913.33   319.66   -\n\n \nThis table is also in the Excel workbook provided. All distances in this table are unique (there are no \nduplicates). \nThe total capacity of each depot is shown in the table below: \n\nDepot        Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\n# Vehicles   2,700    400      100      400      100      400      600      700      900\n\nThe depots are organized into between 1 and 3 hubs under the different the scenarios, as set out below.\n\nALLOCATION METHODOLOGY \nFor legal reasons, allocation must be assessed and performed for each hub in isolation (no cars from one \nhub may be serviced in any other hub). The methodology for allocating vehicles to depots for servicing \nwithin a hub is: \n1) Each vehicle is initially delivered to a certain depot and must be collected from that depot. If MVC \nchooses to transport that vehicle to another depot for servicing, MVC will bear a transportation cost for \nthat vehicle as set out above. \n2) All vehicles are serviced at the depot they arrive, where capacity exists to do so. Where any depot has \nexcess vehicles that cannot be serviced at that depot, vehicles are allocated as per step 3. \n3) Calculate the vehicle that has the shortest trip (and therefore cost) to any other depot with available \ncapacity. Allocate that vehicle to that depot for servicing \n4) Repeat step 3 until either no excess vehicles remain or MVC would choose to instead pay the penalty \nper vehicle (as described above). \n \nNote that MVC’s allocation methodology may not lead to the optimum allocation between depots. You \nneed to model MVC’s allocation methodology as it is set out above, you are not required to make any \nchanges to this methodology. \nAll analysis is conducted on whole vehicles only (no part vehicle calculations are performed). \nSCENARIOS \nThere are 4 different scenarios you need to consider of your model.

MVC have 9 depots (referred to as Depot A to Depot I) which they use to service the vehicles. \nYou are planning for the expected vehicles due next quarter and need to allocate the vehicle intake to the \n9 depots under the allocation methodology that MVC uses. \nMVC earns revenue of $2,000 per vehicle serviced. \nProfit is calculated as revenue less any transportation costs incurred less any penalty costs incurred. \nWhere a vehicle is serviced at a depot other than the one where the customer drops it off, MVC must pay \nthe transport costs associated with getting it to the depot it is serviced at, then back to the original depot \nfor collection. Transport costs are $1.40 per vehicle per mile (part miles are charged pro rata).  \nIf MVC cannot service a vehicle, they must pay a $500 penalty per vehicle. They will pay this penalty in \ntwo situations: \n1) Where there is insufficient capacity within a hub to service a vehicle; and \n2) Where the revenue for a vehicle less the transport costs for that vehicle would be more expensive for \nMVC than not servicing the vehicle and paying the penalty. \nDEPOTS AND HUBS \nThere are 9 depots. The distance between each depot pairing (one way, in miles) is shown in the table \nbelow: \n\n            Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\nDepot A     -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot B     482.00   -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot C     417.00   381.49   -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot D     297.00   681.69   340.00   -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot E     576.00 1,096.43   790.23  362.22   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot F     285.00   853.92   683.40   330.00   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot G     613.00 1,150.65 1,095.05  759.71   577.00   341.00   -        -        -\nDepot H     521.00   791.91   976.13  882.81   993.16   620.00   557.82   -        -\nDepot I     529.43   477.25   819.70  908.42 1,133.92   804.87   913.33   319.66   -\n\n \nThis table is also in the Excel workbook provided. All distances in this table are unique (there are no \nduplicates). \nThe total capacity of each depot is shown in the table below: \n\nDepot        Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\n# Vehicles   2,700    400      100      400      100      400      600      700      900\n\nThe depots are organized into between 1 and 3 hubs under the different the scenarios, as set out below.\n\nALLOCATION METHODOLOGY \nFor legal reasons, allocation must be assessed and performed for each hub in isolation (no cars from one \nhub may be serviced in any other hub). The methodology for allocating vehicles to depots for servicing \nwithin a hub is: \n1) Each vehicle is initially delivered to a certain depot and must be collected from that depot. If MVC \nchooses to transport that vehicle to another depot for servicing, MVC will bear a transportation cost for \nthat vehicle as set out above. \n2) All vehicles are serviced at the depot they arrive, where capacity exists to do so. Where any depot has \nexcess vehicles that cannot be serviced at that depot, vehicles are allocated as per step 3. \n3) Calculate the vehicle that has the shortest trip (and therefore cost) to any other depot with available \ncapacity. Allocate that vehicle to that depot for servicing \n4) Repeat step 3 until either no excess vehicles remain or MVC would choose to instead pay the penalty \nper vehicle (as described above). \n \nNote that MVC’s allocation methodology may not lead to the optimum allocation between depots. You \nneed to model MVC’s allocation methodology as it is set out above, you are not required to make any \nchanges to this methodology. \nAll analysis is conducted on whole vehicles only (no part vehicle calculations are performed). \nSCENARIOS \nThere are 4 different scenarios you need to consider of your model.

MVC have 9 depots (referred to as Depot A to Depot I) which they use to service the vehicles. \nYou are planning for the expected vehicles due next quarter and need to allocate the vehicle intake to the \n9 depots under the allocation methodology that MVC uses. \nMVC earns revenue of $2,000 per vehicle serviced. \nProfit is calculated as revenue less any transportation costs incurred less any penalty costs incurred. \nWhere a vehicle is serviced at a depot other than the one where the customer drops it off, MVC must pay \nthe transport costs associated with getting it to the depot it is serviced at, then back to the original depot \nfor collection. Transport costs are $1.40 per vehicle per mile (part miles are charged pro rata).  \nIf MVC cannot service a vehicle, they must pay a $500 penalty per vehicle. They will pay this penalty in \ntwo situations: \n1) Where there is insufficient capacity within a hub to service a vehicle; and \n2) Where the revenue for a vehicle less the transport costs for that vehicle would be more expensive for \nMVC than not servicing the vehicle and paying the penalty. \nDEPOTS AND HUBS \nThere are 9 depots. The distance between each depot pairing (one way, in miles) is shown in the table \nbelow: \n\n            Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\nDepot A     -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot B     482.00   -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot C     417.00   381.49   -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot D     297.00   681.69   340.00   -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot E     576.00 1,096.43   790.23  362.22   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot F     285.00   853.92   683.40   330.00   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot G     613.00 1,150.65 1,095.05  759.71   577.00   341.00   -        -        -\nDepot H     521.00   791.91   976.13  882.81   993.16   620.00   557.82   -        -\nDepot I     529.43   477.25   819.70  908.42 1,133.92   804.87   913.33   319.66   -\n\n \nThis table is also in the Excel workbook provided. All distances in this table are unique (there are no \nduplicates). \nThe total capacity of each depot is shown in the table below: \n\nDepot        Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\n# Vehicles   2,700    400      100      400      100      400      600      700      900\n\nThe depots are organized into between 1 and 3 hubs under the different the scenarios, as set out below.\n\nALLOCATION METHODOLOGY \nFor legal reasons, allocation must be assessed and performed for each hub in isolation (no cars from one \nhub may be serviced in any other hub). The methodology for allocating vehicles to depots for servicing \nwithin a hub is: \n1) Each vehicle is initially delivered to a certain depot and must be collected from that depot. If MVC \nchooses to transport that vehicle to another depot for servicing, MVC will bear a transportation cost for \nthat vehicle as set out above. \n2) All vehicles are serviced at the depot they arrive, where capacity exists to do so. Where any depot has \nexcess vehicles that cannot be serviced at that depot, vehicles are allocated as per step 3. \n3) Calculate the vehicle that has the shortest trip (and therefore cost) to any other depot with available \ncapacity. Allocate that vehicle to that depot for servicing \n4) Repeat step 3 until either no excess vehicles remain or MVC would choose to instead pay the penalty \nper vehicle (as described above). \n \nNote that MVC’s allocation methodology may not lead to the optimum allocation between depots. You \nneed to model MVC’s allocation methodology as it is set out above, you are not required to make any \nchanges to this methodology. \nAll analysis is conducted on whole vehicles only (no part vehicle calculations are performed). \nSCENARIOS \nThere are 4 different scenarios you need to consider of your model.

MVC have 9 depots (referred to as Depot A to Depot I) which they use to service the vehicles. \nYou are planning for the expected vehicles due next quarter and need to allocate the vehicle intake to the \n9 depots under the allocation methodology that MVC uses. \nMVC earns revenue of $2,000 per vehicle serviced. \nProfit is calculated as revenue less any transportation costs incurred less any penalty costs incurred. \nWhere a vehicle is serviced at a depot other than the one where the customer drops it off, MVC must pay \nthe transport costs associated with getting it to the depot it is serviced at, then back to the original depot \nfor collection. Transport costs are $1.40 per vehicle per mile (part miles are charged pro rata).  \nIf MVC cannot service a vehicle, they must pay a $500 penalty per vehicle. They will pay this penalty in \ntwo situations: \n1) Where there is insufficient capacity within a hub to service a vehicle; and \n2) Where the revenue for a vehicle less the transport costs for that vehicle would be more expensive for \nMVC than not servicing the vehicle and paying the penalty. \nDEPOTS AND HUBS \nThere are 9 depots. The distance between each depot pairing (one way, in miles) is shown in the table \nbelow: \n\n            Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\nDepot A     -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot B     482.00   -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot C     417.00   381.49   -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot D     297.00   681.69   340.00   -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot E     576.00 1,096.43   790.23  362.22   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot F     285.00   853.92   683.40   330.00   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot G     613.00 1,150.65 1,095.05  759.71   577.00   341.00   -        -        -\nDepot H     521.00   791.91   976.13  882.81   993.16   620.00   557.82   -        -\nDepot I     529.43   477.25   819.70  908.42 1,133.92   804.87   913.33   319.66   -\n\n \nThis table is also in the Excel workbook provided. All distances in this table are unique (there are no \nduplicates). \nThe total capacity of each depot is shown in the table below: \n\nDepot        Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\n# Vehicles   2,700    400      100      400      100      400      600      700      900\n\nThe depots are organized into between 1 and 3 hubs under the different the scenarios, as set out below.\n\nALLOCATION METHODOLOGY \nFor legal reasons, allocation must be assessed and performed for each hub in isolation (no cars from one \nhub may be serviced in any other hub). The methodology for allocating vehicles to depots for servicing \nwithin a hub is: \n1) Each vehicle is initially delivered to a certain depot and must be collected from that depot. If MVC \nchooses to transport that vehicle to another depot for servicing, MVC will bear a transportation cost for \nthat vehicle as set out above. \n2) All vehicles are serviced at the depot they arrive, where capacity exists to do so. Where any depot has \nexcess vehicles that cannot be serviced at that depot, vehicles are allocated as per step 3. \n3) Calculate the vehicle that has the shortest trip (and therefore cost) to any other depot with available \ncapacity. Allocate that vehicle to that depot for servicing \n4) Repeat step 3 until either no excess vehicles remain or MVC would choose to instead pay the penalty \nper vehicle (as described above). \n \nNote that MVC’s allocation methodology may not lead to the optimum allocation between depots. You \nneed to model MVC’s allocation methodology as it is set out above, you are not required to make any \nchanges to this methodology. \nAll analysis is conducted on whole vehicles only (no part vehicle calculations are performed). \nSCENARIOS \nThere are 4 different scenarios you need to consider of your model.

MVC have 9 depots (referred to as Depot A to Depot I) which they use to service the vehicles. \nYou are planning for the expected vehicles due next quarter and need to allocate the vehicle intake to the \n9 depots under the allocation methodology that MVC uses. \nMVC earns revenue of $2,000 per vehicle serviced. \nProfit is calculated as revenue less any transportation costs incurred less any penalty costs incurred. \nWhere a vehicle is serviced at a depot other than the one where the customer drops it off, MVC must pay \nthe transport costs associated with getting it to the depot it is serviced at, then back to the original depot \nfor collection. Transport costs are $1.40 per vehicle per mile (part miles are charged pro rata).  \nIf MVC cannot service a vehicle, they must pay a $500 penalty per vehicle. They will pay this penalty in \ntwo situations: \n1) Where there is insufficient capacity within a hub to service a vehicle; and \n2) Where the revenue for a vehicle less the transport costs for that vehicle would be more expensive for \nMVC than not servicing the vehicle and paying the penalty. \nDEPOTS AND HUBS \nThere are 9 depots. The distance between each depot pairing (one way, in miles) is shown in the table \nbelow: \n\n            Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\nDepot A     -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot B     482.00   -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot C     417.00   381.49   -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot D     297.00   681.69   340.00   -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot E     576.00 1,096.43   790.23  362.22   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot F     285.00   853.92   683.40   330.00   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot G     613.00 1,150.65 1,095.05  759.71   577.00   341.00   -        -        -\nDepot H     521.00   791.91   976.13  882.81   993.16   620.00   557.82   -        -\nDepot I     529.43   477.25   819.70  908.42 1,133.92   804.87   913.33   319.66   -\n\n \nThis table is also in the Excel workbook provided. All distances in this table are unique (there are no \nduplicates). \nThe total capacity of each depot is shown in the table below: \n\nDepot        Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\n# Vehicles   2,700    400      100      400      100      400      600      700      900\n\nThe depots are organized into between 1 and 3 hubs under the different the scenarios, as set out below.\n\nALLOCATION METHODOLOGY \nFor legal reasons, allocation must be assessed and performed for each hub in isolation (no cars from one \nhub may be serviced in any other hub). The methodology for allocating vehicles to depots for servicing \nwithin a hub is: \n1) Each vehicle is initially delivered to a certain depot and must be collected from that depot. If MVC \nchooses to transport that vehicle to another depot for servicing, MVC will bear a transportation cost for \nthat vehicle as set out above. \n2) All vehicles are serviced at the depot they arrive, where capacity exists to do so. Where any depot has \nexcess vehicles that cannot be serviced at that depot, vehicles are allocated as per step 3. \n3) Calculate the vehicle that has the shortest trip (and therefore cost) to any other depot with available \ncapacity. Allocate that vehicle to that depot for servicing \n4) Repeat step 3 until either no excess vehicles remain or MVC would choose to instead pay the penalty \nper vehicle (as described above). \n \nNote that MVC’s allocation methodology may not lead to the optimum allocation between depots. You \nneed to model MVC’s allocation methodology as it is set out above, you are not required to make any \nchanges to this methodology. \nAll analysis is conducted on whole vehicles only (no part vehicle calculations are performed). \nSCENARIOS \nThere are 4 different scenarios you need to consider of your model.

MVC have 9 depots (referred to as Depot A to Depot I) which they use to service the vehicles. \nYou are planning for the expected vehicles due next quarter and need to allocate the vehicle intake to the \n9 depots under the allocation methodology that MVC uses. \nMVC earns revenue of $2,000 per vehicle serviced. \nProfit is calculated as revenue less any transportation costs incurred less any penalty costs incurred. \nWhere a vehicle is serviced at a depot other than the one where the customer drops it off, MVC must pay \nthe transport costs associated with getting it to the depot it is serviced at, then back to the original depot \nfor collection. Transport costs are $1.40 per vehicle per mile (part miles are charged pro rata).  \nIf MVC cannot service a vehicle, they must pay a $500 penalty per vehicle. They will pay this penalty in \ntwo situations: \n1) Where there is insufficient capacity within a hub to service a vehicle; and \n2) Where the revenue for a vehicle less the transport costs for that vehicle would be more expensive for \nMVC than not servicing the vehicle and paying the penalty. \nDEPOTS AND HUBS \nThere are 9 depots. The distance between each depot pairing (one way, in miles) is shown in the table \nbelow: \n\n            Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\nDepot A     -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot B     482.00   -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot C     417.00   381.49   -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot D     297.00   681.69   340.00   -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot E     576.00 1,096.43   790.23  362.22   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot F     285.00   853.92   683.40   330.00   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot G     613.00 1,150.65 1,095.05  759.71   577.00   341.00   -        -        -\nDepot H     521.00   791.91   976.13  882.81   993.16   620.00   557.82   -        -\nDepot I     529.43   477.25   819.70  908.42 1,133.92   804.87   913.33   319.66   -\n\n \nThis table is also in the Excel workbook provided. All distances in this table are unique (there are no \nduplicates). \nThe total capacity of each depot is shown in the table below: \n\nDepot        Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\n# Vehicles   2,700    400      100      400      100      400      600      700      900\n\nThe depots are organized into between 1 and 3 hubs under the different the scenarios, as set out below.\n\nALLOCATION METHODOLOGY \nFor legal reasons, allocation must be assessed and performed for each hub in isolation (no cars from one \nhub may be serviced in any other hub). The methodology for allocating vehicles to depots for servicing \nwithin a hub is: \n1) Each vehicle is initially delivered to a certain depot and must be collected from that depot. If MVC \nchooses to transport that vehicle to another depot for servicing, MVC will bear a transportation cost for \nthat vehicle as set out above. \n2) All vehicles are serviced at the depot they arrive, where capacity exists to do so. Where any depot has \nexcess vehicles that cannot be serviced at that depot, vehicles are allocated as per step 3. \n3) Calculate the vehicle that has the shortest trip (and therefore cost) to any other depot with available \ncapacity. Allocate that vehicle to that depot for servicing \n4) Repeat step 3 until either no excess vehicles remain or MVC would choose to instead pay the penalty \nper vehicle (as described above). \n \nNote that MVC’s allocation methodology may not lead to the optimum allocation between depots. You \nneed to model MVC’s allocation methodology as it is set out above, you are not required to make any \nchanges to this methodology. \nAll analysis is conducted on whole vehicles only (no part vehicle calculations are performed). \nSCENARIOS \nThere are 4 different scenarios you need to consider of your model.

MVC have 9 depots (referred to as Depot A to Depot I) which they use to service the vehicles. \nYou are planning for the expected vehicles due next quarter and need to allocate the vehicle intake to the \n9 depots under the allocation methodology that MVC uses. \nMVC earns revenue of $2,000 per vehicle serviced. \nProfit is calculated as revenue less any transportation costs incurred less any penalty costs incurred. \nWhere a vehicle is serviced at a depot other than the one where the customer drops it off, MVC must pay \nthe transport costs associated with getting it to the depot it is serviced at, then back to the original depot \nfor collection. Transport costs are $1.40 per vehicle per mile (part miles are charged pro rata).  \nIf MVC cannot service a vehicle, they must pay a $500 penalty per vehicle. They will pay this penalty in \ntwo situations: \n1) Where there is insufficient capacity within a hub to service a vehicle; and \n2) Where the revenue for a vehicle less the transport costs for that vehicle would be more expensive for \nMVC than not servicing the vehicle and paying the penalty. \nDEPOTS AND HUBS \nThere are 9 depots. The distance between each depot pairing (one way, in miles) is shown in the table \nbelow: \n\n            Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\nDepot A     -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot B     482.00   -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot C     417.00   381.49   -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot D     297.00   681.69   340.00   -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot E     576.00 1,096.43   790.23  362.22   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot F     285.00   853.92   683.40   330.00   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot G     613.00 1,150.65 1,095.05  759.71   577.00   341.00   -        -        -\nDepot H     521.00   791.91   976.13  882.81   993.16   620.00   557.82   -        -\nDepot I     529.43   477.25   819.70  908.42 1,133.92   804.87   913.33   319.66   -\n\n \nThis table is also in the Excel workbook provided. All distances in this table are unique (there are no \nduplicates). \nThe total capacity of each depot is shown in the table below: \n\nDepot        Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\n# Vehicles   2,700    400      100      400      100      400      600      700      900\n\nThe depots are organized into between 1 and 3 hubs under the different the scenarios, as set out below.\n\nALLOCATION METHODOLOGY \nFor legal reasons, allocation must be assessed and performed for each hub in isolation (no cars from one \nhub may be serviced in any other hub). The methodology for allocating vehicles to depots for servicing \nwithin a hub is: \n1) Each vehicle is initially delivered to a certain depot and must be collected from that depot. If MVC \nchooses to transport that vehicle to another depot for servicing, MVC will bear a transportation cost for \nthat vehicle as set out above. \n2) All vehicles are serviced at the depot they arrive, where capacity exists to do so. Where any depot has \nexcess vehicles that cannot be serviced at that depot, vehicles are allocated as per step 3. \n3) Calculate the vehicle that has the shortest trip (and therefore cost) to any other depot with available \ncapacity. Allocate that vehicle to that depot for servicing \n4) Repeat step 3 until either no excess vehicles remain or MVC would choose to instead pay the penalty \nper vehicle (as described above). \n \nNote that MVC’s allocation methodology may not lead to the optimum allocation between depots. You \nneed to model MVC’s allocation methodology as it is set out above, you are not required to make any \nchanges to this methodology. \nAll analysis is conducted on whole vehicles only (no part vehicle calculations are performed). \nSCENARIOS \nThere are 4 different scenarios you need to consider of your model.

MVC have 9 depots (referred to as Depot A to Depot I) which they use to service the vehicles. \nYou are planning for the expected vehicles due next quarter and need to allocate the vehicle intake to the \n9 depots under the allocation methodology that MVC uses. \nMVC earns revenue of $2,000 per vehicle serviced. \nProfit is calculated as revenue less any transportation costs incurred less any penalty costs incurred. \nWhere a vehicle is serviced at a depot other than the one where the customer drops it off, MVC must pay \nthe transport costs associated with getting it to the depot it is serviced at, then back to the original depot \nfor collection. Transport costs are $1.40 per vehicle per mile (part miles are charged pro rata).  \nIf MVC cannot service a vehicle, they must pay a $500 penalty per vehicle. They will pay this penalty in \ntwo situations: \n1) Where there is insufficient capacity within a hub to service a vehicle; and \n2) Where the revenue for a vehicle less the transport costs for that vehicle would be more expensive for \nMVC than not servicing the vehicle and paying the penalty. \nDEPOTS AND HUBS \nThere are 9 depots. The distance between each depot pairing (one way, in miles) is shown in the table \nbelow: \n\n            Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\nDepot A     -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot B     482.00   -        -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot C     417.00   381.49   -        -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot D     297.00   681.69   340.00   -        -        -        -        -        -\nDepot E     576.00 1,096.43   790.23  362.22   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot F     285.00   853.92   683.40   330.00   -        -        -        -        -\nDepot G     613.00 1,150.65 1,095.05  759.71   577.00   341.00   -        -        -\nDepot H     521.00   791.91   976.13  882.81   993.16   620.00   557.82   -        -\nDepot I     529.43   477.25   819.70  908.42 1,133.92   804.87   913.33   319.66   -\n\n \nThis table is also in the Excel workbook provided. All distances in this table are unique (there are no \nduplicates). \nThe total capacity of each depot is shown in the table below: \n\nDepot        Depot A  Depot B  Depot C  Depot D  Depot E  Depot F  Depot G  Depot H  Depot I\n# Vehicles   2,700    400      100      400      100      400      600      700      900\n\nThe depots are organized into between 1 and 3 hubs under the different the scenarios, as set out below.\n\nALLOCATION METHODOLOGY \nFor legal reasons, allocation must be assessed and performed for each hub in isolation (no cars from one \nhub may be serviced in any other hub). The methodology for allocating vehicles to depots for servicing \nwithin a hub is: \n1) Each vehicle is initially delivered to a certain depot and must be collected from that depot. If MVC \nchooses to transport that vehicle to another depot for servicing, MVC will bear a transportation cost for \nthat vehicle as set out above. \n2) All vehicles are serviced at the depot they arrive, where capacity exists to do so. Where any depot has \nexcess vehicles that cannot be serviced at that depot, vehicles are allocated as per step 3. \n3) Calculate the vehicle that has the shortest trip (and therefore cost) to any other depot with available \ncapacity. Allocate that vehicle to that depot for servicing \n4) Repeat step 3 until either no excess vehicles remain or MVC would choose to instead pay the penalty \nper vehicle (as described above). \n \nNote that MVC’s allocation methodology may not lead to the optimum allocation between depots. You \nneed to model MVC’s allocation methodology as it is set out above, you are not required to make any \nchanges to this methodology. \nAll analysis is conducted on whole vehicles only (no part vehicle calculations are performed). \nSCENARIOS \nThere are 4 different scenarios you need to consider of your model.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

This \nList is the source of allowed words for the purpose of this Section. \nTASK \nYour task is to build a model that has the following functions: \nWhen supplied with \ni) An input string of 7 letters (e.g. F I N A N C E) or an input string of 6 letters and a wildcard;\nii) a value for N equal to 5, 6, 7 representing the length of the words; and\niii) a value for X (a positive integer)\nyour model should be able to identify: \n1) How many unique words of length N from the List can be made using the input letters. (For clarity, the \norder of the letters can be rearranged, and each input letter can only be used once per word.  So, if \nFINANCE was the input string and N is 5, INANE (2 N’s) is allowed but FENCE (2 E’s) is not. Also, \ncount INANE once only, not twice.); \n2) For a given value of X, the Xth word in an alphabetical sorted list of the words found in (1); \n3) Which word from those found in (1) scores the highest amount of points when placed in its optimal \nspot on the Board (details on next page).  If more than one word scores the maximum, give the word \nthat would appear first in an alphabetical list of the highest scoring words; and \n4) The score achieved from the optimal placement of the word in (3) above. \n \nASSESSMENT \nAfter 60 minutes of development time, you will be given an answer sheet containing a list of 15 input \nstrings each with its N value and its X value, and space to write your answers.  You will then have an \nadditional 20 minutes to continue work and to find and write down the values for items (1) to (4) above for \neach of the 15 input strings, for a total of 60 answers.  All answers are worth 1 mark each.  An example \nQuestion and its correct answers are provided on the next page to help you self-assess your model. \nTo make the questions more challenging, instead of 7 regular letters, input strings 11 to 15 will contain \n6 letters followed by one wildcard (denoted by a question mark “?”).  The wildcard can be used as any \nof the 26 letters when finding words from the List, and can be used as different letters for different words.  \nFor example, if the input string is “NUMBER?” and N is 5, both RERUN and UNDER are allowed.  In the \nscoring, the wildcard character will have the same points value as the letter it represents.  Also, there is no \ndistinction between RERUN and RERUN.  Count that word once only. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT HINTS \nThe provided workbook includes the worksheet ‘Permutation’ which contains all 5,040 permutations of \nways to list the digits 1 through 7.  You may find this useful. \nDevelopment Hint: Save often, and avoid double-clicking on the fill-handle box (the small square at the \nbottom right of a selected range) in order to apply a formula down a column containing tens of thousands \nof rows.  Doing so has a tendency to freeze Excel.  Use a different method to apply a formula to very large \namounts of cells at once. \n\nSCORING AND THE ‘BOARD’ \nEach letter (A to Z) has been assigned a points value (from 1 to 10), and the wildcard will share the points \nvalue of the letter it represents.  The points per letter can be found on the ‘Scoring’ worksheet of the \nprovided workbook. \nThe Board is a 1 * 13 array of squares, with each square having a multiplier value of 1, 2 or 3.  A word \nmay be placed on the Board with 1 letter per 1 square starting in any position on the Board, provided that: \ni) The placement runs continuously from left to right;\nii) The middle square (#7) is always occupied;\niii) The whole word is placed and final letter does not extend past the end of the Board.\n \nThe ‘Scoring’ worksheet shows an example.

The format was a \ndouble round-robin with each team playing all other teams twice, once at home and once away, for a total \nof 38 games per team. \nYou have been provided data for all 380 games.  10 data fields are provided for each game.  They are: \n\nField Name     Description\nDate           The date of the game, given as text in the format yyyymmdd.\nRound          The number of the round (between 1 and 38)\nTeam_H         The name of the home team.\nTeam_A         The name of the away team.\nScore_H        The number of goals scored by the home team.\nScore_A        The number of goals scored by the away team.\nTime_HG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each home goal was scored. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               Minute values followed by an asterisk (*) denote that the goal was from a Penalty Kick.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nTime_AG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each away goal was scored. Other details are as per the Time_HG field.\nPlayer_HG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each home goal. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               The first value corresponds to the first home goal scored, the second value to the second home goal scored, and so on.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nPlayer_AG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each away goal. Other details are as per the Player_HG field.\n\n \nThe winner of each game is the team that scores the most goals.  If the score is tied, the game is a draw. \nYour task is to build a model of the league ladder, but this model will need to be flexible to answer all of \nthe questions.  Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.  Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.  After answering each question, remove the effects of any filtering \nbefore proceeding to the next question. \n\nQuestion 1 \nHow many goals did Bari score in the season?

They are: \n\nField Name     Description\nDate           The date of the game, given as text in the format yyyymmdd.\nRound          The number of the round (between 1 and 38)\nTeam_H         The name of the home team.\nTeam_A         The name of the away team.\nScore_H        The number of goals scored by the home team.\nScore_A        The number of goals scored by the away team.\nTime_HG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each home goal was scored. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               Minute values followed by an asterisk (*) denote that the goal was from a Penalty Kick.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nTime_AG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each away goal was scored. Other details are as per the Time_HG field.\nPlayer_HG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each home goal. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               The first value corresponds to the first home goal scored, the second value to the second home goal scored, and so on.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nPlayer_AG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each away goal. Other details are as per the Player_HG field.\n\n \nThe winner of each game is the team that scores the most goals.  If the score is tied, the game is a draw. \nYour task is to build a model of the league ladder, but this model will need to be flexible to answer all of \nthe questions.  Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.  Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.  After answering each question, remove the effects of any filtering \nbefore proceeding to the next question. \n\nQuestion 2 (Free field answer) \nWhich team conceded exactly 60 goals in the season?

Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.  Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.  After answering each question, remove the effects of any filtering \nbefore proceeding to the next question. \n\nQuestion 3 \nHow many teams finished the season with more than 5 0 points?

The format was a \ndouble round-robin with each team playing all other teams twice, once at home and once away, for a total \nof 38 games per team. \nYou have been provided data for all 380 games.  10 data fields are provided for each game.  They are: \n\nField Name     Description\nDate           The date of the game, given as text in the format yyyymmdd.\nRound          The number of the round (between 1 and 38)\nTeam_H         The name of the home team.\nTeam_A         The name of the away team.\nScore_H        The number of goals scored by the home team.\nScore_A        The number of goals scored by the away team.\nTime_HG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each home goal was scored. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               Minute values followed by an asterisk (*) denote that the goal was from a Penalty Kick.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nTime_AG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each away goal was scored. Other details are as per the Time_HG field.\nPlayer_HG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each home goal. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               The first value corresponds to the first home goal scored, the second value to the second home goal scored, and so on.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nPlayer_AG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each away goal. Other details are as per the Player_HG field.\n\n \nThe winner of each game is the team that scores the most goals.  If the score is tied, the game is a draw. \nYour task is to build a model of the league ladder, but this model will need to be flexible to answer all of \nthe questions.  Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.

The format was a \ndouble round-robin with each team playing all other teams twice, once at home and once away, for a total \nof 38 games per team. \nYou have been provided data for all 380 games.  10 data fields are provided for each game.  They are: \n\nField Name     Description\nDate           The date of the game, given as text in the format yyyymmdd.\nRound          The number of the round (between 1 and 38)\nTeam_H         The name of the home team.\nTeam_A         The name of the away team.\nScore_H        The number of goals scored by the home team.\nScore_A        The number of goals scored by the away team.\nTime_HG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each home goal was scored. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               Minute values followed by an asterisk (*) denote that the goal was from a Penalty Kick.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nTime_AG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each away goal was scored. Other details are as per the Time_HG field.\nPlayer_HG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each home goal. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               The first value corresponds to the first home goal scored, the second value to the second home goal scored, and so on.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nPlayer_AG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each away goal. Other details are as per the Player_HG field.\n\n \nThe winner of each game is the team that scores the most goals.  If the score is tied, the game is a draw. \nYour task is to build a model of the league ladder, but this model will need to be flexible to answer all of \nthe questions.  Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.  Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.  After answering each question, remove the effects of any filtering \nbefore proceeding to the next question. \n\nQuestion 5 (Free field answer) \nWhich team was the first ranked team? [1 mark]

Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.  After answering each question, remove the effects of any filtering \nbefore proceeding to the next question. \n\nQuestion 6 \nHow many teams finished the season with the same nu mber of points as another team?

The format was a \ndouble round-robin with each team playing all other teams twice, once at home and once away, for a total \nof 38 games per team. \nYou have been provided data for all 380 games.  10 data fields are provided for each game.  They are: \n\nField Name     Description\nDate           The date of the game, given as text in the format yyyymmdd.\nRound          The number of the round (between 1 and 38)\nTeam_H         The name of the home team.\nTeam_A         The name of the away team.\nScore_H        The number of goals scored by the home team.\nScore_A        The number of goals scored by the away team.\nTime_HG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each home goal was scored. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               Minute values followed by an asterisk (*) denote that the goal was from a Penalty Kick.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nTime_AG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each away goal was scored. Other details are as per the Time_HG field.\nPlayer_HG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each home goal. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               The first value corresponds to the first home goal scored, the second value to the second home goal scored, and so on.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nPlayer_AG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each away goal. Other details are as per the Player_HG field.\n\n \nThe winner of each game is the team that scores the most goals.  If the score is tied, the game is a draw. \nYour task is to build a model of the league ladder, but this model will need to be flexible to answer all of \nthe questions.  Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.

The format was a \ndouble round-robin with each team playing all other teams twice, once at home and once away, for a total \nof 38 games per team. \nYou have been provided data for all 380 games.  10 data fields are provided for each game.  They are: \n\nField Name     Description\nDate           The date of the game, given as text in the format yyyymmdd.\nRound          The number of the round (between 1 and 38)\nTeam_H         The name of the home team.\nTeam_A         The name of the away team.\nScore_H        The number of goals scored by the home team.\nScore_A        The number of goals scored by the away team.\nTime_HG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each home goal was scored. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               Minute values followed by an asterisk (*) denote that the goal was from a Penalty Kick.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nTime_AG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each away goal was scored. Other details are as per the Time_HG field.\nPlayer_HG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each home goal. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               The first value corresponds to the first home goal scored, the second value to the second home goal scored, and so on.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nPlayer_AG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each away goal. Other details are as per the Player_HG field.\n\n \nThe winner of each game is the team that scores the most goals.  If the score is tied, the game is a draw. \nYour task is to build a model of the league ladder, but this model will need to be flexible to answer all of \nthe questions.  Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.  Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.  After answering each question, remove the effects of any filtering \nbefore proceeding to the next question. \n\nQuestion 8 \nWhat is the Check Sum value for the ladder as it st ood at 31 Dec 2016?

The format was a \ndouble round-robin with each team playing all other teams twice, once at home and once away, for a total \nof 38 games per team. \nYou have been provided data for all 380 games.  10 data fields are provided for each game.  They are: \n\nField Name     Description\nDate           The date of the game, given as text in the format yyyymmdd.\nRound          The number of the round (between 1 and 38)\nTeam_H         The name of the home team.\nTeam_A         The name of the away team.\nScore_H        The number of goals scored by the home team.\nScore_A        The number of goals scored by the away team.\nTime_HG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each home goal was scored. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               Minute values followed by an asterisk (*) denote that the goal was from a Penalty Kick.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nTime_AG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each away goal was scored. Other details are as per the Time_HG field.\nPlayer_HG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each home goal. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               The first value corresponds to the first home goal scored, the second value to the second home goal scored, and so on.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nPlayer_AG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each away goal. Other details are as per the Player_HG field.\n\n \nThe winner of each game is the team that scores the most goals.  If the score is tied, the game is a draw. \nYour task is to build a model of the league ladder, but this model will need to be flexible to answer all of \nthe questions.  Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.  Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.

If the score is tied, the game is a draw. \nYour task is to build a model of the league ladder, but this model will need to be flexible to answer all of \nthe questions.  Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.  Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.  After answering each question, remove the effects of any filtering \nbefore proceeding to the next question. \n\nQuestion 11 \nAssume that all goals from Penalty Kicks are remove d from the data, and the scores and results of \neach game are changed accordingly. Compile the end of season ladder based on this assumption. \nWhat is the Check Sum of the ladder? [3 marks] \nA 84664 D 97715 G 108072 \nB 89058 E 100948 H 113040 \nC 93082 F 104912 I 117930

(For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.  After answering each question, remove the effects of any filtering \nbefore proceeding to the next question. \n\nQuestion 12 \n(Remember to reset the filters from the previous qu estion to their default value) \nAssume that all games for the season ended at Half Time, so that only goals scored in minutes 1 \nto 45 inclusive are counted. Compile the ladder as of 28 Feb 2017 based on this assumption. \nWhat is the Check Sum of the ladder? [4 marks] \nA 75493 D 88918 G 100956 \nB 79142 E 93118 H 104007 \nC 83960 F 96793 I 107303

The format was a \ndouble round-robin with each team playing all other teams twice, once at home and once away, for a total \nof 38 games per team. \nYou have been provided data for all 380 games.  10 data fields are provided for each game.  They are: \n\nField Name     Description\nDate           The date of the game, given as text in the format yyyymmdd.\nRound          The number of the round (between 1 and 38)\nTeam_H         The name of the home team.\nTeam_A         The name of the away team.\nScore_H        The number of goals scored by the home team.\nScore_A        The number of goals scored by the away team.\nTime_HG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each home goal was scored. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               Minute values followed by an asterisk (*) denote that the goal was from a Penalty Kick.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nTime_AG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each away goal was scored. Other details are as per the Time_HG field.\nPlayer_HG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each home goal. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               The first value corresponds to the first home goal scored, the second value to the second home goal scored, and so on.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nPlayer_AG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each away goal. Other details are as per the Player_HG field.\n\n \nThe winner of each game is the team that scores the most goals.  If the score is tied, the game is a draw. \nYour task is to build a model of the league ladder, but this model will need to be flexible to answer all of \nthe questions.  Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.  Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.

The format was a \ndouble round-robin with each team playing all other teams twice, once at home and once away, for a total \nof 38 games per team. \nYou have been provided data for all 380 games.  10 data fields are provided for each game.  They are: \n\nField Name     Description\nDate           The date of the game, given as text in the format yyyymmdd.\nRound          The number of the round (between 1 and 38)\nTeam_H         The name of the home team.\nTeam_A         The name of the away team.\nScore_H        The number of goals scored by the home team.\nScore_A        The number of goals scored by the away team.\nTime_HG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each home goal was scored.

If the score is tied, the game is a draw. \nYour task is to build a model of the league ladder, but this model will need to be flexible to answer all of \nthe questions.  Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.  Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.  After answering each question, remove the effects of any filtering \nbefore proceeding to the next question. \n\nQuestion 14 (Free field answer) \n(Remember to reset the filters from the previous qu estion to their default value) \nWhat is the Check Sum of the ladder as at 12 Oct 20 16?

Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.  After answering each question, remove the effects of any filtering \nbefore proceeding to the next question. \n\nQuestion 15 (Free field answer) \nFiltering the data so that we only count games play ed on a Saturday or a Monday throughout the \nwhole season, which team finishes in 7 th place on the end of season ladder?

This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               Minute values followed by an asterisk (*) denote that the goal was from a Penalty Kick.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nTime_AG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each away goal was scored. Other details are as per the Time_HG field.\nPlayer_HG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each home goal. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               The first value corresponds to the first home goal scored, the second value to the second home goal scored, and so on.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nPlayer_AG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each away goal. Other details are as per the Player_HG field.\n\n \nThe winner of each game is the team that scores the most goals.  If the score is tied, the game is a draw. \nYour task is to build a model of the league ladder, but this model will need to be flexible to answer all of \nthe questions.  Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.  Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.  After answering each question, remove the effects of any filtering \nbefore proceeding to the next question. \n\nQuestion 17 (Free field answer) \n(Remember to reset the filters from the previous qu estion to their default value) \nWhat is the Check Sum of the ladder as at 5 Oct 201 6?

The format was a \ndouble round-robin with each team playing all other teams twice, once at home and once away, for a total \nof 38 games per team. \nYou have been provided data for all 380 games.  10 data fields are provided for each game.  They are: \n\nField Name     Description\nDate           The date of the game, given as text in the format yyyymmdd.\nRound          The number of the round (between 1 and 38)\nTeam_H         The name of the home team.\nTeam_A         The name of the away team.\nScore_H        The number of goals scored by the home team.\nScore_A        The number of goals scored by the away team.\nTime_HG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each home goal was scored. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               Minute values followed by an asterisk (*) denote that the goal was from a Penalty Kick.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nTime_AG        Which minute in the game (between 1 and 95) each away goal was scored. Other details are as per the Time_HG field.\nPlayer_HG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each home goal. This is given as a single text string with each goal separated by a comma (,).\n               The first value corresponds to the first home goal scored, the second value to the second home goal scored, and so on.\n               If there were no home goals, "---" is the value given.\nPlayer_AG      The jersey number of the goal scorer (between 1 and 22) of each away goal. Other details are as per the Player_HG field.\n\n \nThe winner of each game is the team that scores the most goals.  If the score is tied, the game is a draw. \nYour task is to build a model of the league ladder, but this model will need to be flexible to answer all of \nthe questions.  Read through the questions first to get a sense of what flexibility is required. \nLADDER RULES FOR RANKING TEAMS \nFor each game, teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.  Teams \nare ranked on the ladder according to the following criteria, in this order: \n1) Highest number of points \n2) For teams on equal points, rank by highest goal difference (total goals scored less total goals \nconceded) \n3) For teams on equal points and goal difference, rank by highest total goals scored \n4) If two or more teams are still equal after (3), rank those teams equally, but list the equally ranked \nteams in alphabetical order.  (For avoidance of doubt, if M teams are equally ranked in position N, the \nnext best team will have rank N+M, not rank N+1.) \n\nLIST OF TEAMS \nAdrianople\nAni\nAntioch\nBari\nChalcedon\nCherson\nConstantinople\nDyrrachium\nEdessa\nIconium\nKars\nNaissus\nNicaea\nNicomedia\nOhrid\nPrilep\nSamosata\nSardica\nTrebizond\nVarna\n \nThis list of teams is also provided in column B of the worksheet ‘Check_Sum’. \nFor any questions where the answer is one of the teams, give the Team name, and not the team ID \nnumber. \nTHE CHECK_SUM WORKSHEET \nYou should add your own worksheets to the provided data file to perform your calculations and model your \nleague ladder.  Some of the questions will ask you for the value of the Check_Sum of a given ladder.  For \nthese questions, you should link cells D3:D22 and E3:E22 to your calculated ladder, and then submit \nthe value in the green cell at cell F25.  The use of the Check Sum is designed simply to be a way to easily \nassess if all of your ladder ranking positions are correct. \nYou can also use the list of team names from cells B3:B20.  You should not use this Check Sum \nworksheet for anything else, nor make any edits to it except for the yellow cells D3:E22. \nInstructions on how to sort your ladder: \nLike any traditional sporting league, your ladder should be sorted by rank, with rank 1 (the highest placed \nteam) at the top and rank 20 (the lowest placed team) at the bottom.  If a ladder contains two or more \nteams on equal rank (see point 4 in ‘Ladder Rules for Ranking Teams), equally ranked teams should then \nfurther be sorted alphabetically by team name for display purposes, but still given an equal rank value. \nNote that a different displayed sort order will give a different Check sum value from the intended answer. \n \nQUESTION SUMMARY \nQuestions 1 to 7 are based on the complete data set, with no filtering required. \nQuestions 8 to 19 may require you to compile a ladder assuming that some goals and/or some games \nhave been filtered out of the data.  After answering each question, remove the effects of any filtering \nbefore proceeding to the next question. \n\nQuestion 19 (Free field answer) \n(Remember to reset the filters from the previous qu estion to their default value) \nEvery goal is scored by a player wearing a Jersey n umber between 1 and 22. If we remove from \nthe data all goals scored by Jersey number N, what single value of N (from 1 to 22) will give the \nlargest end of season ladder Check Sum? [3 marks]

For teams A and B, the two games between A and B represent a \nseries . The cumulative scores of the two games make up t he result of each series. If one team has \nscored more goals than the other team across the se ries, that team wins. For example, if the game 1 \nscore (A as home team vs B as away team) is 3-0 in favor of A, and if the game 2 score (B as home team \nvs A as away team) is a 2-2 draw, then A wins the s eries 5-2. \nIf the series score shows a tie, then the “Away Goa ls” tie-break rule is used. Whichever of the two te ams \nscored more Away goals across the series is declare d the winner. If the two teams are still tied afte r \napplication of the Away goals rule, the series is d eclared a draw. \nGo to the worksheet ‘Bonus’. The table contains 19 0 yellow cells in the upper triangle. Each yellow cell \nneeds to represent the overall result of the two-ga me series between the team shown on the left hand \ncolumn and the team shown on the top row. \nPopulate each yellow cell with the team ID number ( 1 through 20) of the team that won that series. If the \nseries was a tie, leave the cell value as zero. \nIn each of the 20 blue cells (main diagonal) and 19 0 grey cells (lower triangle) make sure the value o f zero \nremains entered. \n \nA shortened version of these instructions is also p rovided on the ‘Bonus’ worksheet tab. \n \nWhat is the value of the Bonus Check Sum?

       DSBench/data/00000011, INTRODUCTION\nYou have taken on a role in the organising committee for the 2015 Underwater Football World \nChampionship. Your first task is to help the committee understand the potential total cost of flights for the \nchampionship. As part of this, you will need to build a model to allow you to identify flight details and costs \nfor all domestic flights for each team in the Championship.  \nIn order to calculate the potential cost, you are provided with the following information about the \ntournament:  \n1) The tournament consistent of 24 teams divided into four pools, each containing six teams. Each has \nan animal name that the team is referred to by. \n2) There are 60 pool games followed by 7 finals games.  \n3) There are 12 cities in the country that games are held at. Each city is named after a colour.  \n4) All teams will start and end the tournament at Purple City as this has the country's main international \nairport. The costs of the international flights to arrive at, and depart from, the tournament are paid for \nby the individual teams so are not to be included in this analysis. \n5) Whenever a team travels, flights for the entire squad of team personnel must be arranged. \n6) The organising committee has taken a view on which teams will progress to each game in the finals \nfor the purposes of calculating these costs.  Base your modelling on the assumption that the finals \nwill be played by the specified teams (shown in the supporting Excel file). \nSUPPORTING DATA \nThe required information has been collated by the organising team and given to you in an Excel file. This \nfile includes:  \n1) A list of the teams competing  \n2) A list of the cities where games are played  \n3) The total number of personnel per team requiring flights (the squad size) \n4) The teams involved in, date of, and venue used, for each game  \n5) The flight costs per person between each location  \nHINT: When designing your model, to answer all questions you may find it useful for your model to \ncalculate: Flights costs by team; Flight costs by departure city; Flight costs by arrival city; Flights costs \nwithin a specified range of dates; Flight costs if some game venues change from the base case. \n \n \n\nQuestion 1 What is the total expected number of flights the Elephants will need during the tournament? Hint: Remember that teams start and end at Purple City. a. 4 flights b. 5 flights c. 6 flights d. 7 flight

for the 2015 Underwater Football World \nChampionship. Your first task is to help the committee understand the potential total cost of flights for the \nchampionship. As part of this, you will need to build a model to allow you to identify flight details and costs \nfor all domestic flights for each team in the Championship.  \nIn order to calculate the potential cost, you are provided with the following information about the \ntournament:  \n1) The tournament consistent of 24 teams divided into four pools, each containing six teams. Each has \nan animal name that the team is referred to by. \n2) There are 60 pool games followed by 7 finals games.  \n3) There are 12 cities in the country that games are held at. Each city is named after a colour.  \n4) All teams will start and end the tournament at Purple City as this has the country's main international \nairport. The costs of the international flights to arrive at, and depart from, the tournament are paid for \nby the individual teams so are not to be included in this analysis. \n5) Whenever a team travels, flights for the entire squad of team personnel must be arranged. \n6) The organising committee has taken a view on which teams will progress to each game in the finals \nfor the purposes of calculating these costs.  Base your modelling on the assumption that the finals \nwill be played by the specified teams (shown in the supporting Excel file). \nSUPPORTING DATA \nThe required information has been collated by the organising team and given to you in an Excel file. This \nfile includes:  \n1) A list of the teams competing  \n2) A list of the cities where games are played  \n3) The total number of personnel per team requiring flights (the squad size) \n4) The teams involved in, date of, and venue used, for each game  \n5) The flight costs per person between each location  \nHINT: When designing your model, to answer all questions you may find it useful for your model to \ncalculate: Flights costs by team; Flight costs by departure city; Flight costs by arrival city; Flights costs \nwithin a specified range of dates; Flight costs if some game venues change from the base case. \n \n \n\nQuestion 2 What is the total expected flight cost for the Frogs? a. $15,246 b. $16,548 c. $24,612 d. $25,43

Underwater Football World \nChampionship. Your first task is to help the committee understand the potential total cost of flights for the \nchampionship. As part of this, you will need to build a model to allow you to identify flight details and costs \nfor all domestic flights for each team in the Championship.  \nIn order to calculate the potential cost, you are provided with the following information about the \ntournament:  \n1) The tournament consistent of 24 teams divided into four pools, each containing six teams. Each has \nan animal name that the team is referred to by. \n2) There are 60 pool games followed by 7 finals games.  \n3) There are 12 cities in the country that games are held at. Each city is named after a colour.  \n4) All teams will start and end the tournament at Purple City as this has the country's main international \nairport. The costs of the international flights to arrive at, and depart from, the tournament are paid for \nby the individual teams so are not to be included in this analysis. \n5) Whenever a team travels, flights for the entire squad of team personnel must be arranged. \n6) The organising committee has taken a view on which teams will progress to each game in the finals \nfor the purposes of calculating these costs.  Base your modelling on the assumption that the finals \nwill be played by the specified teams (shown in the supporting Excel file). \nSUPPORTING DATA \nThe required information has been collated by the organising team and given to you in an Excel file. This \nfile includes:  \n1) A list of the teams competing  \n2) A list of the cities where games are played  \n3) The total number of personnel per team requiring flights (the squad size) \n4) The teams involved in, date of, and venue used, for each game  \n5) The flight costs per person between each location  \nHINT: When designing your model, to answer all questions you may find it useful for your model to \ncalculate: Flights costs by team; Flight costs by departure city; Flight costs by arrival city; Flights costs \nwithin a specified range of dates; Flight costs if some game venues change from the base case. \n \n \n\nQuestion 3 What is the total expected flight cost for the competition? a. $587,223 b. $632,499 c. $664,713 d. $666,414

for the 2015 Underwater Football World \nChampionship. Your first task is to help the committee understand the potential total cost of flights for the \nchampionship. As part of this, you will need to build a model to allow you to identify flight details and costs \nfor all domestic flights for each team in the Championship.  \nIn order to calculate the potential cost, you are provided with the following information about the \ntournament:  \n1) The tournament consistent of 24 teams divided into four pools, each containing six teams. Each has \nan animal name that the team is referred to by. \n2) There are 60 pool games followed by 7 finals games.  \n3) There are 12 cities in the country that games are held at. Each city is named after a colour.  \n4) All teams will start and end the tournament at Purple City as this has the country's main international \nairport. The costs of the international flights to arrive at, and depart from, the tournament are paid for \nby the individual teams so are not to be included in this analysis. \n5) Whenever a team travels, flights for the entire squad of team personnel must be arranged. \n6) The organising committee has taken a view on which teams will progress to each game in the finals \nfor the purposes of calculating these costs.  Base your modelling on the assumption that the finals \nwill be played by the specified teams (shown in the supporting Excel file). \nSUPPORTING DATA \nThe required information has been collated by the organising team and given to you in an Excel file. This \nfile includes:  \n1) A list of the teams competing  \n2) A list of the cities where games are played  \n3) The total number of personnel per team requiring flights (the squad size) \n4) The teams involved in, date of, and venue used, for each game  \n5) The flight costs per person between each location  \nHINT: When designing your model, to answer all questions you may find it useful for your model to \ncalculate: Flights costs by team; Flight costs by departure city; Flight costs by arrival city; Flights costs \nwithin a specified range of dates; Flight costs if some game venues change from the base case. \n \n \n\nQuestion 4 What is the total cost for all flights to Lime City? a. $46,242 b. $47,985 c. $48,930 d. $49,01

Your first task is to help the committee understand the potential total cost of flights for the \nchampionship. As part of this, you will need to build a model to allow you to identify flight details and costs \nfor all domestic flights for each team in the Championship.  \nIn order to calculate the potential cost, you are provided with the following information about the \ntournament:  \n1) The tournament consistent of 24 teams divided into four pools, each containing six teams. Each has \nan animal name that the team is referred to by. \n2) There are 60 pool games followed by 7 finals games.  \n3) There are 12 cities in the country that games are held at. Each city is named after a colour.  \n4) All teams will start and end the tournament at Purple City as this has the country's main international \nairport. The costs of the international flights to arrive at, and depart from, the tournament are paid for \nby the individual teams so are not to be included in this analysis. \n5) Whenever a team travels, flights for the entire squad of team personnel must be arranged. \n6) The organising committee has taken a view on which teams will progress to each game in the finals \nfor the purposes of calculating these costs.  Base your modelling on the assumption that the finals \nwill be played by the specified teams (shown in the supporting Excel file). \nSUPPORTING DATA \nThe required information has been collated by the organising team and given to you in an Excel file. This \nfile includes:  \n1) A list of the teams competing  \n2) A list of the cities where games are played  \n3) The total number of personnel per team requiring flights (the squad size) \n4) The teams involved in, date of, and venue used, for each game  \n5) The flight costs per person between each location  \nHINT: When designing your model, to answer all questions you may find it useful for your model to \ncalculate: Flights costs by team; Flight costs by departure city; Flight costs by arrival city; Flights costs \nwithin a specified range of dates; Flight costs if some game venues change from the base case. \n \n \n\nQuestion 6 What is the total flight cost for all flights to games held between 11 May and 19 May (inclusive)? a. $126,630 b. $127,890 c. $128,940 d. $129,045

on a role in the organising committee for the 2015 Underwater Football World \nChampionship. Your first task is to help the committee understand the potential total cost of flights for the \nchampionship. As part of this, you will need to build a model to allow you to identify flight details and costs \nfor all domestic flights for each team in the Championship.  \nIn order to calculate the potential cost, you are provided with the following information about the \ntournament:  \n1) The tournament consistent of 24 teams divided into four pools, each containing six teams. Each has \nan animal name that the team is referred to by. \n2) There are 60 pool games followed by 7 finals games.  \n3) There are 12 cities in the country that games are held at. Each city is named after a colour.  \n4) All teams will start and end the tournament at Purple City as this has the country's main international \nairport. The costs of the international flights to arrive at, and depart from, the tournament are paid for \nby the individual teams so are not to be included in this analysis. \n5) Whenever a team travels, flights for the entire squad of team personnel must be arranged. \n6) The organising committee has taken a view on which teams will progress to each game in the finals \nfor the purposes of calculating these costs.  Base your modelling on the assumption that the finals \nwill be played by the specified teams (shown in the supporting Excel file). \nSUPPORTING DATA \nThe required information has been collated by the organising team and given to you in an Excel file. This \nfile includes:  \n1) A list of the teams competing  \n2) A list of the cities where games are played  \n3) The total number of personnel per team requiring flights (the squad size) \n4) The teams involved in, date of, and venue used, for each game  \n5) The flight costs per person between each location  \nHINT: When designing your model, to answer all questions you may find it useful for your model to \ncalculate: Flights costs by team; Flight costs by departure city; Flight costs by arrival city; Flights costs \nwithin a specified range of dates; Flight costs if some game venues change from the base case. \n \n \n\nQuestion 7 The organising committee want to assess the impact on the total flight cost if all teams start and end the tournament at Green City rather than Purple City. What is the total expected flight cost if this happens? a. $626,829 b. $663,978 c. $675,843 d. $716,41

\nChampionship. Your first task is to help the committee understand the potential total cost of flights for the \nchampionship. As part of this, you will need to build a model to allow you to identify flight details and costs \nfor all domestic flights for each team in the Championship.  \nIn order to calculate the potential cost, you are provided with the following information about the \ntournament:  \n1) The tournament consistent of 24 teams divided into four pools, each containing six teams. Each has \nan animal name that the team is referred to by. \n2) There are 60 pool games followed by 7 finals games.  \n3) There are 12 cities in the country that games are held at. Each city is named after a colour.  \n4) All teams will start and end the tournament at Purple City as this has the country's main international \nairport. The costs of the international flights to arrive at, and depart from, the tournament are paid for \nby the individual teams so are not to be included in this analysis. \n5) Whenever a team travels, flights for the entire squad of team personnel must be arranged. \n6) The organising committee has taken a view on which teams will progress to each game in the finals \nfor the purposes of calculating these costs.  Base your modelling on the assumption that the finals \nwill be played by the specified teams (shown in the supporting Excel file). \nSUPPORTING DATA \nThe required information has been collated by the organising team and given to you in an Excel file. This \nfile includes:  \n1) A list of the teams competing  \n2) A list of the cities where games are played  \n3) The total number of personnel per team requiring flights (the squad size) \n4) The teams involved in, date of, and venue used, for each game  \n5) The flight costs per person between each location  \nHINT: When designing your model, to answer all questions you may find it useful for your model to \ncalculate: Flights costs by team; Flight costs by departure city; Flight costs by arrival city; Flights costs \nwithin a specified range of dates; Flight costs if some game venues change from the base case. \n \n \n\nQuestion 8 Due to construction issues, all games at the Blue City may need to be moved to the Orange City. What will be the impact on the total expected flight cost if this happens? (For this question, make sure the start/end city has been reset to the Purple City.) a. $7,917 increase b. $9,723 decrease c. $21,462 decrease d. $32,256 decrease

The model forecasts the project’s cashflows, \nincluding the existing senior debt. Your manager has provided this spreadsheet to you and asked you to \nupdate it to include the upcoming refinancing, and to amend the project’s forecast financial statements to \naccount for this. \n \nPART A \nThe inputs below are provided in the “Inputs” worksheet of the provided model. \nTerms of the refinancing debt are as follows: \n \nThe facility will be drawn in one single drawdown on 31 December 2016. \n \nAn arrangement fee of 2% is payable on the amount drawn. \n \nThe amount drawn will be equal to the sum of: \no \nThe balance of the existing senior debt after the repayment on 31 December 2016 is made and; \no \nThe arrangement fee amount. \n \nThe drawdown will be used to pay the arrangement fee and repay the existing debt. \n \nRepayments will be made at the end of each calendar year, apart from in the final year when the \nrepayment is made on the final repayment date. \n \nThe final repayment date should be 30 June 2036, and the debt should be repaid in full on this \ndate. \n \nThe repayment amount in Year N = Opening Balance at start of year * [Days in year N for which \nrefinancing debt is active] / [Total days from the start of Year N until the debt maturity date \ninclusive]. Repayments start from the 2017 year (i.e. there is no repayment relating to 31 \nDecember 2016). \n \nThe interest rate for the loan is 6% and interest should be calculated on an actual/365 basis. \n \nThe company should account for the debt as follows: \n \nInterest should be expensed through the Profit and Loss accounts as incurred. \n \nThe arrangement fee should be amortized through the Profit and Loss accounts over the life of the \nloan according to the following formula: \no \nAmortization charge in Year N = Fee Charged * [Days in year N for which refinancing debt is \nactive] / [Total number of days across all years for which refinancing debt is active] \n \nOn the Cash Flow Statement, the arrangement fee should be incorporated after the Project \nCashflow line, and it should feed in to the Dividends calculation. \n \nThe project will hold on the balance sheet both the refinancing debt balance, and an asset relating \nto the arrangement fee.\n \nPART B \nYour manager has also asked you to calculate a Debt Service Cover Ratio (“DSCR”) for the refinancing \ndebt to show how much buffer the project has in its cashflows above the amount required to pay the \ninterest and repayments for the refinancing debt. \n \nIn each year that the refinanced loan is active (excluding 2016) this DSCR should be calculated as: \n \nNumerator: \nProject cashflow (as displayed on the Cash Flow Statement) \nApportioned for the number of days in the year that falls within the term of the refinancing debt. \n \nDenominator: \nInterest and Principal Repayments made for the refinancing debt during the year. \n \nYou will also need to calculate a minimum and average DSCR.  The minimum DSCR should be the \nminimum of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt, and the average DSCR should be the \naverage of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt.   \n \nYou should answer question 6 before proceeding with the remainder of Part B. \n \nOn seeing the minimum DSCR that the project achieves, your manager tells you that this is higher than \nthe banks require – they are willing to lend money to the project as long as the DSCR remains at or above \n1.80 in each year.  As the DSCR is well above this level, the project could afford to make larger \nrepayments in each period, and therefore the initial drawdown could have been larger. \n \nYour manager wishes to amend the model so that as much debt is borrowed as possible given the \nconstraint that the DSCR cannot ever be below 1.80. Any excess amount drawn over and above the \namount needed to repay the existing senior debt and pay the arrangement fee should be distributed \nimmediately to the shareholders. \n \nTo this end, you have been asked to adjust the drawdown amount and the debt repayments (which may \nnow vary independently in each year) so that in each year a DSCR of exactly 1.80 is achieved and the \ndebt is repaid in full on the final repayment date. \n \nQuestions 1 to 6 relate to Part A. \nQuestions 7 to 10 relate to Part B. \n\nQuestion 1 \nWhat is the amount drawn for the refinancing debt in Part A ?

The model forecasts the project’s cashflows, \nincluding the existing senior debt. Your manager has provided this spreadsheet to you and asked you to \nupdate it to include the upcoming refinancing, and to amend the project’s forecast financial statements to \naccount for this. \n \nPART A \nThe inputs below are provided in the “Inputs” worksheet of the provided model. \nTerms of the refinancing debt are as follows: \n \nThe facility will be drawn in one single drawdown on 31 December 2016. \n \nAn arrangement fee of 2% is payable on the amount drawn. \n \nThe amount drawn will be equal to the sum of: \no \nThe balance of the existing senior debt after the repayment on 31 December 2016 is made and; \no \nThe arrangement fee amount. \n \nThe drawdown will be used to pay the arrangement fee and repay the existing debt. \n \nRepayments will be made at the end of each calendar year, apart from in the final year when the \nrepayment is made on the final repayment date. \n \nThe final repayment date should be 30 June 2036, and the debt should be repaid in full on this \ndate. \n \nThe repayment amount in Year N = Opening Balance at start of year * [Days in year N for which \nrefinancing debt is active] / [Total days from the start of Year N until the debt maturity date \ninclusive]. Repayments start from the 2017 year (i.e. there is no repayment relating to 31 \nDecember 2016). \n \nThe interest rate for the loan is 6% and interest should be calculated on an actual/365 basis. \n \nThe company should account for the debt as follows: \n \nInterest should be expensed through the Profit and Loss accounts as incurred. \n \nThe arrangement fee should be amortized through the Profit and Loss accounts over the life of the \nloan according to the following formula: \no \nAmortization charge in Year N = Fee Charged * [Days in year N for which refinancing debt is \nactive] / [Total number of days across all years for which refinancing debt is active] \n \nOn the Cash Flow Statement, the arrangement fee should be incorporated after the Project \nCashflow line, and it should feed in to the Dividends calculation. \n \nThe project will hold on the balance sheet both the refinancing debt balance, and an asset relating \nto the arrangement fee.\n \nPART B \nYour manager has also asked you to calculate a Debt Service Cover Ratio (“DSCR”) for the refinancing \ndebt to show how much buffer the project has in its cashflows above the amount required to pay the \ninterest and repayments for the refinancing debt. \n \nIn each year that the refinanced loan is active (excluding 2016) this DSCR should be calculated as: \n \nNumerator: \nProject cashflow (as displayed on the Cash Flow Statement) \nApportioned for the number of days in the year that falls within the term of the refinancing debt. \n \nDenominator: \nInterest and Principal Repayments made for the refinancing debt during the year. \n \nYou will also need to calculate a minimum and average DSCR.  The minimum DSCR should be the \nminimum of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt, and the average DSCR should be the \naverage of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt.   \n \nYou should answer question 6 before proceeding with the remainder of Part B. \n \nOn seeing the minimum DSCR that the project achieves, your manager tells you that this is higher than \nthe banks require – they are willing to lend money to the project as long as the DSCR remains at or above \n1.80 in each year.  As the DSCR is well above this level, the project could afford to make larger \nrepayments in each period, and therefore the initial drawdown could have been larger. \n \nYour manager wishes to amend the model so that as much debt is borrowed as possible given the \nconstraint that the DSCR cannot ever be below 1.80. Any excess amount drawn over and above the \namount needed to repay the existing senior debt and pay the arrangement fee should be distributed \nimmediately to the shareholders. \n \nTo this end, you have been asked to adjust the drawdown amount and the debt repayments (which may \nnow vary independently in each year) so that in each year a DSCR of exactly 1.80 is achieved and the \ndebt is repaid in full on the final repayment date. \n \nQuestions 1 to 6 relate to Part A. \nQuestions 7 to 10 relate to Part B. \n\nQuestion 2 \nWhat is the refinance debt repayment amount on 31 December 2022 in Part A ?

The model forecasts the project’s cashflows, \nincluding the existing senior debt. Your manager has provided this spreadsheet to you and asked you to \nupdate it to include the upcoming refinancing, and to amend the project’s forecast financial statements to \naccount for this. \n \nPART A \nThe inputs below are provided in the “Inputs” worksheet of the provided model. \nTerms of the refinancing debt are as follows: \n \nThe facility will be drawn in one single drawdown on 31 December 2016. \n \nAn arrangement fee of 2% is payable on the amount drawn. \n \nThe amount drawn will be equal to the sum of: \no \nThe balance of the existing senior debt after the repayment on 31 December 2016 is made and; \no \nThe arrangement fee amount. \n \nThe drawdown will be used to pay the arrangement fee and repay the existing debt. \n \nRepayments will be made at the end of each calendar year, apart from in the final year when the \nrepayment is made on the final repayment date. \n \nThe final repayment date should be 30 June 2036, and the debt should be repaid in full on this \ndate. \n \nThe repayment amount in Year N = Opening Balance at start of year * [Days in year N for which \nrefinancing debt is active] / [Total days from the start of Year N until the debt maturity date \ninclusive]. Repayments start from the 2017 year (i.e. there is no repayment relating to 31 \nDecember 2016). \n \nThe interest rate for the loan is 6% and interest should be calculated on an actual/365 basis. \n \nThe company should account for the debt as follows: \n \nInterest should be expensed through the Profit and Loss accounts as incurred. \n \nThe arrangement fee should be amortized through the Profit and Loss accounts over the life of the \nloan according to the following formula: \no \nAmortization charge in Year N = Fee Charged * [Days in year N for which refinancing debt is \nactive] / [Total number of days across all years for which refinancing debt is active] \n \nOn the Cash Flow Statement, the arrangement fee should be incorporated after the Project \nCashflow line, and it should feed in to the Dividends calculation. \n \nThe project will hold on the balance sheet both the refinancing debt balance, and an asset relating \nto the arrangement fee.\n \nPART B \nYour manager has also asked you to calculate a Debt Service Cover Ratio (“DSCR”) for the refinancing \ndebt to show how much buffer the project has in its cashflows above the amount required to pay the \ninterest and repayments for the refinancing debt. \n \nIn each year that the refinanced loan is active (excluding 2016) this DSCR should be calculated as: \n \nNumerator: \nProject cashflow (as displayed on the Cash Flow Statement) \nApportioned for the number of days in the year that falls within the term of the refinancing debt. \n \nDenominator: \nInterest and Principal Repayments made for the refinancing debt during the year. \n \nYou will also need to calculate a minimum and average DSCR.  The minimum DSCR should be the \nminimum of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt, and the average DSCR should be the \naverage of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt.   \n \nYou should answer question 6 before proceeding with the remainder of Part B. \n \nOn seeing the minimum DSCR that the project achieves, your manager tells you that this is higher than \nthe banks require – they are willing to lend money to the project as long as the DSCR remains at or above \n1.80 in each year.  As the DSCR is well above this level, the project could afford to make larger \nrepayments in each period, and therefore the initial drawdown could have been larger. \n \nYour manager wishes to amend the model so that as much debt is borrowed as possible given the \nconstraint that the DSCR cannot ever be below 1.80. Any excess amount drawn over and above the \namount needed to repay the existing senior debt and pay the arrangement fee should be distributed \nimmediately to the shareholders. \n \nTo this end, you have been asked to adjust the drawdown amount and the debt repayments (which may \nnow vary independently in each year) so that in each year a DSCR of exactly 1.80 is achieved and the \ndebt is repaid in full on the final repayment date. \n \nQuestions 1 to 6 relate to Part A. \nQuestions 7 to 10 relate to Part B. \n\nQuestion 3 \nWhat is the arrangement fee amortization in 2024 ?

The model forecasts the project’s cashflows, \nincluding the existing senior debt. Your manager has provided this spreadsheet to you and asked you to \nupdate it to include the upcoming refinancing, and to amend the project’s forecast financial statements to \naccount for this. \n \nPART A \nThe inputs below are provided in the “Inputs” worksheet of the provided model. \nTerms of the refinancing debt are as follows: \n \nThe facility will be drawn in one single drawdown on 31 December 2016. \n \nAn arrangement fee of 2% is payable on the amount drawn. \n \nThe amount drawn will be equal to the sum of: \no \nThe balance of the existing senior debt after the repayment on 31 December 2016 is made and; \no \nThe arrangement fee amount. \n \nThe drawdown will be used to pay the arrangement fee and repay the existing debt. \n \nRepayments will be made at the end of each calendar year, apart from in the final year when the \nrepayment is made on the final repayment date. \n \nThe final repayment date should be 30 June 2036, and the debt should be repaid in full on this \ndate. \n \nThe repayment amount in Year N = Opening Balance at start of year * [Days in year N for which \nrefinancing debt is active] / [Total days from the start of Year N until the debt maturity date \ninclusive]. Repayments start from the 2017 year (i.e. there is no repayment relating to 31 \nDecember 2016). \n \nThe interest rate for the loan is 6% and interest should be calculated on an actual/365 basis. \n \nThe company should account for the debt as follows: \n \nInterest should be expensed through the Profit and Loss accounts as incurred. \n \nThe arrangement fee should be amortized through the Profit and Loss accounts over the life of the \nloan according to the following formula: \no \nAmortization charge in Year N = Fee Charged * [Days in year N for which refinancing debt is \nactive] / [Total number of days across all years for which refinancing debt is active] \n \nOn the Cash Flow Statement, the arrangement fee should be incorporated after the Project \nCashflow line, and it should feed in to the Dividends calculation. \n \nThe project will hold on the balance sheet both the refinancing debt balance, and an asset relating \nto the arrangement fee.\n \nPART B \nYour manager has also asked you to calculate a Debt Service Cover Ratio (“DSCR”) for the refinancing \ndebt to show how much buffer the project has in its cashflows above the amount required to pay the \ninterest and repayments for the refinancing debt. \n \nIn each year that the refinanced loan is active (excluding 2016) this DSCR should be calculated as: \n \nNumerator: \nProject cashflow (as displayed on the Cash Flow Statement) \nApportioned for the number of days in the year that falls within the term of the refinancing debt. \n \nDenominator: \nInterest and Principal Repayments made for the refinancing debt during the year. \n \nYou will also need to calculate a minimum and average DSCR.  The minimum DSCR should be the \nminimum of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt, and the average DSCR should be the \naverage of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt.   \n \nYou should answer question 6 before proceeding with the remainder of Part B. \n \nOn seeing the minimum DSCR that the project achieves, your manager tells you that this is higher than \nthe banks require – they are willing to lend money to the project as long as the DSCR remains at or above \n1.80 in each year.  As the DSCR is well above this level, the project could afford to make larger \nrepayments in each period, and therefore the initial drawdown could have been larger. \n \nYour manager wishes to amend the model so that as much debt is borrowed as possible given the \nconstraint that the DSCR cannot ever be below 1.80. Any excess amount drawn over and above the \namount needed to repay the existing senior debt and pay the arrangement fee should be distributed \nimmediately to the shareholders. \n \nTo this end, you have been asked to adjust the drawdown amount and the debt repayments (which may \nnow vary independently in each year) so that in each year a DSCR of exactly 1.80 is achieved and the \ndebt is repaid in full on the final repayment date. \n \nQuestions 1 to 6 relate to Part A. \nQuestions 7 to 10 relate to Part B. \n\nQuestion 4 \nWhat is the total interest paid for the refinancing loan in Part A ?

Your manager has provided this spreadsheet to you and asked you to \nupdate it to include the upcoming refinancing, and to amend the project’s forecast financial statements to \naccount for this. \n \nPART A \nThe inputs below are provided in the “Inputs” worksheet of the provided model. \nTerms of the refinancing debt are as follows: \n \nThe facility will be drawn in one single drawdown on 31 December 2016. \n \nAn arrangement fee of 2% is payable on the amount drawn. \n \nThe amount drawn will be equal to the sum of: \no \nThe balance of the existing senior debt after the repayment on 31 December 2016 is made and; \no \nThe arrangement fee amount. \n \nThe drawdown will be used to pay the arrangement fee and repay the existing debt. \n \nRepayments will be made at the end of each calendar year, apart from in the final year when the \nrepayment is made on the final repayment date. \n \nThe final repayment date should be 30 June 2036, and the debt should be repaid in full on this \ndate. \n \nThe repayment amount in Year N = Opening Balance at start of year * [Days in year N for which \nrefinancing debt is active] / [Total days from the start of Year N until the debt maturity date \ninclusive]. Repayments start from the 2017 year (i.e. there is no repayment relating to 31 \nDecember 2016). \n \nThe interest rate for the loan is 6% and interest should be calculated on an actual/365 basis. \n \nThe company should account for the debt as follows: \n \nInterest should be expensed through the Profit and Loss accounts as incurred. \n \nThe arrangement fee should be amortized through the Profit and Loss accounts over the life of the \nloan according to the following formula: \no \nAmortization charge in Year N = Fee Charged * [Days in year N for which refinancing debt is \nactive] / [Total number of days across all years for which refinancing debt is active] \n \nOn the Cash Flow Statement, the arrangement fee should be incorporated after the Project \nCashflow line, and it should feed in to the Dividends calculation. \n \nThe project will hold on the balance sheet both the refinancing debt balance, and an asset relating \nto the arrangement fee.\n \nPART B \nYour manager has also asked you to calculate a Debt Service Cover Ratio (“DSCR”) for the refinancing \ndebt to show how much buffer the project has in its cashflows above the amount required to pay the \ninterest and repayments for the refinancing debt. \n \nIn each year that the refinanced loan is active (excluding 2016) this DSCR should be calculated as: \n \nNumerator: \nProject cashflow (as displayed on the Cash Flow Statement) \nApportioned for the number of days in the year that falls within the term of the refinancing debt. \n \nDenominator: \nInterest and Principal Repayments made for the refinancing debt during the year. \n \nYou will also need to calculate a minimum and average DSCR.  The minimum DSCR should be the \nminimum of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt, and the average DSCR should be the \naverage of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt.   \n \nYou should answer question 6 before proceeding with the remainder of Part B. \n \nOn seeing the minimum DSCR that the project achieves, your manager tells you that this is higher than \nthe banks require – they are willing to lend money to the project as long as the DSCR remains at or above \n1.80 in each year.  As the DSCR is well above this level, the project could afford to make larger \nrepayments in each period, and therefore the initial drawdown could have been larger. \n \nYour manager wishes to amend the model so that as much debt is borrowed as possible given the \nconstraint that the DSCR cannot ever be below 1.80. Any excess amount drawn over and above the \namount needed to repay the existing senior debt and pay the arrangement fee should be distributed \nimmediately to the shareholders. \n \nTo this end, you have been asked to adjust the drawdown amount and the debt repayments (which may \nnow vary independently in each year) so that in each year a DSCR of exactly 1.80 is achieved and the \ndebt is repaid in full on the final repayment date. \n \nQuestions 1 to 6 relate to Part A. \nQuestions 7 to 10 relate to Part B. \n\nQuestion 5 \nWhat is the dividend paid in 2034 in Part A ?

Your manager has provided this spreadsheet to you and asked you to \nupdate it to include the upcoming refinancing, and to amend the project’s forecast financial statements to \naccount for this. \n \nPART A \nThe inputs below are provided in the “Inputs” worksheet of the provided model. \nTerms of the refinancing debt are as follows: \n \nThe facility will be drawn in one single drawdown on 31 December 2016. \n \nAn arrangement fee of 2% is payable on the amount drawn. \n \nThe amount drawn will be equal to the sum of: \no \nThe balance of the existing senior debt after the repayment on 31 December 2016 is made and; \no \nThe arrangement fee amount. \n \nThe drawdown will be used to pay the arrangement fee and repay the existing debt. \n \nRepayments will be made at the end of each calendar year, apart from in the final year when the \nrepayment is made on the final repayment date. \n \nThe final repayment date should be 30 June 2036, and the debt should be repaid in full on this \ndate. \n \nThe repayment amount in Year N = Opening Balance at start of year * [Days in year N for which \nrefinancing debt is active] / [Total days from the start of Year N until the debt maturity date \ninclusive]. Repayments start from the 2017 year (i.e. there is no repayment relating to 31 \nDecember 2016). \n \nThe interest rate for the loan is 6% and interest should be calculated on an actual/365 basis. \n \nThe company should account for the debt as follows: \n \nInterest should be expensed through the Profit and Loss accounts as incurred. \n \nThe arrangement fee should be amortized through the Profit and Loss accounts over the life of the \nloan according to the following formula: \no \nAmortization charge in Year N = Fee Charged * [Days in year N for which refinancing debt is \nactive] / [Total number of days across all years for which refinancing debt is active] \n \nOn the Cash Flow Statement, the arrangement fee should be incorporated after the Project \nCashflow line, and it should feed in to the Dividends calculation. \n \nThe project will hold on the balance sheet both the refinancing debt balance, and an asset relating \nto the arrangement fee.\n \nPART B \nYour manager has also asked you to calculate a Debt Service Cover Ratio (“DSCR”) for the refinancing \ndebt to show how much buffer the project has in its cashflows above the amount required to pay the \ninterest and repayments for the refinancing debt. \n \nIn each year that the refinanced loan is active (excluding 2016) this DSCR should be calculated as: \n \nNumerator: \nProject cashflow (as displayed on the Cash Flow Statement) \nApportioned for the number of days in the year that falls within the term of the refinancing debt. \n \nDenominator: \nInterest and Principal Repayments made for the refinancing debt during the year. \n \nYou will also need to calculate a minimum and average DSCR.  The minimum DSCR should be the \nminimum of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt, and the average DSCR should be the \naverage of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt.   \n \nYou should answer question 6 before proceeding with the remainder of Part B. \n \nOn seeing the minimum DSCR that the project achieves, your manager tells you that this is higher than \nthe banks require – they are willing to lend money to the project as long as the DSCR remains at or above \n1.80 in each year.  As the DSCR is well above this level, the project could afford to make larger \nrepayments in each period, and therefore the initial drawdown could have been larger. \n \nYour manager wishes to amend the model so that as much debt is borrowed as possible given the \nconstraint that the DSCR cannot ever be below 1.80. Any excess amount drawn over and above the \namount needed to repay the existing senior debt and pay the arrangement fee should be distributed \nimmediately to the shareholders. \n \nTo this end, you have been asked to adjust the drawdown amount and the debt repayments (which may \nnow vary independently in each year) so that in each year a DSCR of exactly 1.80 is achieved and the \ndebt is repaid in full on the final repayment date. \n \nQuestions 1 to 6 relate to Part A. \nQuestions 7 to 10 relate to Part B. \n\nQuestion 6 \nWhat are the Net Assets on the balance sheet on 31 December 2020 in Part A ?

Your manager has provided this spreadsheet to you and asked you to \nupdate it to include the upcoming refinancing, and to amend the project’s forecast financial statements to \naccount for this. \n \nPART A \nThe inputs below are provided in the “Inputs” worksheet of the provided model. \nTerms of the refinancing debt are as follows: \n \nThe facility will be drawn in one single drawdown on 31 December 2016. \n \nAn arrangement fee of 2% is payable on the amount drawn. \n \nThe amount drawn will be equal to the sum of: \no \nThe balance of the existing senior debt after the repayment on 31 December 2016 is made and; \no \nThe arrangement fee amount. \n \nThe drawdown will be used to pay the arrangement fee and repay the existing debt. \n \nRepayments will be made at the end of each calendar year, apart from in the final year when the \nrepayment is made on the final repayment date. \n \nThe final repayment date should be 30 June 2036, and the debt should be repaid in full on this \ndate. \n \nThe repayment amount in Year N = Opening Balance at start of year * [Days in year N for which \nrefinancing debt is active] / [Total days from the start of Year N until the debt maturity date \ninclusive]. Repayments start from the 2017 year (i.e. there is no repayment relating to 31 \nDecember 2016). \n \nThe interest rate for the loan is 6% and interest should be calculated on an actual/365 basis. \n \nThe company should account for the debt as follows: \n \nInterest should be expensed through the Profit and Loss accounts as incurred. \n \nThe arrangement fee should be amortized through the Profit and Loss accounts over the life of the \nloan according to the following formula: \no \nAmortization charge in Year N = Fee Charged * [Days in year N for which refinancing debt is \nactive] / [Total number of days across all years for which refinancing debt is active] \n \nOn the Cash Flow Statement, the arrangement fee should be incorporated after the Project \nCashflow line, and it should feed in to the Dividends calculation. \n \nThe project will hold on the balance sheet both the refinancing debt balance, and an asset relating \nto the arrangement fee.\n \nPART B \nYour manager has also asked you to calculate a Debt Service Cover Ratio (“DSCR”) for the refinancing \ndebt to show how much buffer the project has in its cashflows above the amount required to pay the \ninterest and repayments for the refinancing debt. \n \nIn each year that the refinanced loan is active (excluding 2016) this DSCR should be calculated as: \n \nNumerator: \nProject cashflow (as displayed on the Cash Flow Statement) \nApportioned for the number of days in the year that falls within the term of the refinancing debt. \n \nDenominator: \nInterest and Principal Repayments made for the refinancing debt during the year. \n \nYou will also need to calculate a minimum and average DSCR.  The minimum DSCR should be the \nminimum of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt, and the average DSCR should be the \naverage of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt.   \n \nYou should answer question 6 before proceeding with the remainder of Part B. \n \nOn seeing the minimum DSCR that the project achieves, your manager tells you that this is higher than \nthe banks require – they are willing to lend money to the project as long as the DSCR remains at or above \n1.80 in each year.  As the DSCR is well above this level, the project could afford to make larger \nrepayments in each period, and therefore the initial drawdown could have been larger. \n \nYour manager wishes to amend the model so that as much debt is borrowed as possible given the \nconstraint that the DSCR cannot ever be below 1.80. Any excess amount drawn over and above the \namount needed to repay the existing senior debt and pay the arrangement fee should be distributed \nimmediately to the shareholders. \n \nTo this end, you have been asked to adjust the drawdown amount and the debt repayments (which may \nnow vary independently in each year) so that in each year a DSCR of exactly 1.80 is achieved and the \ndebt is repaid in full on the final repayment date. \n \nQuestions 1 to 6 relate to Part A. \nQuestions 7 to 10 relate to Part B. \n\nQuestion 7 \nWhat is the average DSCR prior to amending the repayment mechanism?

Your manager has provided this spreadsheet to you and asked you to \nupdate it to include the upcoming refinancing, and to amend the project’s forecast financial statements to \naccount for this. \n \nPART A \nThe inputs below are provided in the “Inputs” worksheet of the provided model. \nTerms of the refinancing debt are as follows: \n \nThe facility will be drawn in one single drawdown on 31 December 2016. \n \nAn arrangement fee of 2% is payable on the amount drawn. \n \nThe amount drawn will be equal to the sum of: \no \nThe balance of the existing senior debt after the repayment on 31 December 2016 is made and; \no \nThe arrangement fee amount. \n \nThe drawdown will be used to pay the arrangement fee and repay the existing debt. \n \nRepayments will be made at the end of each calendar year, apart from in the final year when the \nrepayment is made on the final repayment date. \n \nThe final repayment date should be 30 June 2036, and the debt should be repaid in full on this \ndate. \n \nThe repayment amount in Year N = Opening Balance at start of year * [Days in year N for which \nrefinancing debt is active] / [Total days from the start of Year N until the debt maturity date \ninclusive]. Repayments start from the 2017 year (i.e. there is no repayment relating to 31 \nDecember 2016). \n \nThe interest rate for the loan is 6% and interest should be calculated on an actual/365 basis. \n \nThe company should account for the debt as follows: \n \nInterest should be expensed through the Profit and Loss accounts as incurred. \n \nThe arrangement fee should be amortized through the Profit and Loss accounts over the life of the \nloan according to the following formula: \no \nAmortization charge in Year N = Fee Charged * [Days in year N for which refinancing debt is \nactive] / [Total number of days across all years for which refinancing debt is active] \n \nOn the Cash Flow Statement, the arrangement fee should be incorporated after the Project \nCashflow line, and it should feed in to the Dividends calculation. \n \nThe project will hold on the balance sheet both the refinancing debt balance, and an asset relating \nto the arrangement fee.\n \nPART B \nYour manager has also asked you to calculate a Debt Service Cover Ratio (“DSCR”) for the refinancing \ndebt to show how much buffer the project has in its cashflows above the amount required to pay the \ninterest and repayments for the refinancing debt. \n \nIn each year that the refinanced loan is active (excluding 2016) this DSCR should be calculated as: \n \nNumerator: \nProject cashflow (as displayed on the Cash Flow Statement) \nApportioned for the number of days in the year that falls within the term of the refinancing debt. \n \nDenominator: \nInterest and Principal Repayments made for the refinancing debt during the year. \n \nYou will also need to calculate a minimum and average DSCR.  The minimum DSCR should be the \nminimum of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt, and the average DSCR should be the \naverage of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt.   \n \nYou should answer question 6 before proceeding with the remainder of Part B. \n \nOn seeing the minimum DSCR that the project achieves, your manager tells you that this is higher than \nthe banks require – they are willing to lend money to the project as long as the DSCR remains at or above \n1.80 in each year.  As the DSCR is well above this level, the project could afford to make larger \nrepayments in each period, and therefore the initial drawdown could have been larger. \n \nYour manager wishes to amend the model so that as much debt is borrowed as possible given the \nconstraint that the DSCR cannot ever be below 1.80. Any excess amount drawn over and above the \namount needed to repay the existing senior debt and pay the arrangement fee should be distributed \nimmediately to the shareholders. \n \nTo this end, you have been asked to adjust the drawdown amount and the debt repayments (which may \nnow vary independently in each year) so that in each year a DSCR of exactly 1.80 is achieved and the \ndebt is repaid in full on the final repayment date. \n \nQuestions 1 to 6 relate to Part A. \nQuestions 7 to 10 relate to Part B. \n\nQuestion 8 \nWhat is the target debt service amount (i.e. Interest Payment plus Principal Repayment) on 30 \nJune 2036 in Part B ?

Your manager has provided this spreadsheet to you and asked you to \nupdate it to include the upcoming refinancing, and to amend the project’s forecast financial statements to \naccount for this. \n \nPART A \nThe inputs below are provided in the “Inputs” worksheet of the provided model. \nTerms of the refinancing debt are as follows: \n \nThe facility will be drawn in one single drawdown on 31 December 2016. \n \nAn arrangement fee of 2% is payable on the amount drawn. \n \nThe amount drawn will be equal to the sum of: \no \nThe balance of the existing senior debt after the repayment on 31 December 2016 is made and; \no \nThe arrangement fee amount. \n \nThe drawdown will be used to pay the arrangement fee and repay the existing debt. \n \nRepayments will be made at the end of each calendar year, apart from in the final year when the \nrepayment is made on the final repayment date. \n \nThe final repayment date should be 30 June 2036, and the debt should be repaid in full on this \ndate. \n \nThe repayment amount in Year N = Opening Balance at start of year * [Days in year N for which \nrefinancing debt is active] / [Total days from the start of Year N until the debt maturity date \ninclusive]. Repayments start from the 2017 year (i.e. there is no repayment relating to 31 \nDecember 2016). \n \nThe interest rate for the loan is 6% and interest should be calculated on an actual/365 basis. \n \nThe company should account for the debt as follows: \n \nInterest should be expensed through the Profit and Loss accounts as incurred. \n \nThe arrangement fee should be amortized through the Profit and Loss accounts over the life of the \nloan according to the following formula: \no \nAmortization charge in Year N = Fee Charged * [Days in year N for which refinancing debt is \nactive] / [Total number of days across all years for which refinancing debt is active] \n \nOn the Cash Flow Statement, the arrangement fee should be incorporated after the Project \nCashflow line, and it should feed in to the Dividends calculation. \n \nThe project will hold on the balance sheet both the refinancing debt balance, and an asset relating \nto the arrangement fee.\n \nPART B \nYour manager has also asked you to calculate a Debt Service Cover Ratio (“DSCR”) for the refinancing \ndebt to show how much buffer the project has in its cashflows above the amount required to pay the \ninterest and repayments for the refinancing debt. \n \nIn each year that the refinanced loan is active (excluding 2016) this DSCR should be calculated as: \n \nNumerator: \nProject cashflow (as displayed on the Cash Flow Statement) \nApportioned for the number of days in the year that falls within the term of the refinancing debt. \n \nDenominator: \nInterest and Principal Repayments made for the refinancing debt during the year. \n \nYou will also need to calculate a minimum and average DSCR.  The minimum DSCR should be the \nminimum of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt, and the average DSCR should be the \naverage of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt.   \n \nYou should answer question 6 before proceeding with the remainder of Part B. \n \nOn seeing the minimum DSCR that the project achieves, your manager tells you that this is higher than \nthe banks require – they are willing to lend money to the project as long as the DSCR remains at or above \n1.80 in each year.  As the DSCR is well above this level, the project could afford to make larger \nrepayments in each period, and therefore the initial drawdown could have been larger. \n \nYour manager wishes to amend the model so that as much debt is borrowed as possible given the \nconstraint that the DSCR cannot ever be below 1.80. Any excess amount drawn over and above the \namount needed to repay the existing senior debt and pay the arrangement fee should be distributed \nimmediately to the shareholders. \n \nTo this end, you have been asked to adjust the drawdown amount and the debt repayments (which may \nnow vary independently in each year) so that in each year a DSCR of exactly 1.80 is achieved and the \ndebt is repaid in full on the final repayment date. \n \nQuestions 1 to 6 relate to Part A. \nQuestions 7 to 10 relate to Part B. \n\nQuestion 9 \nIf the amount drawn for the refinancing debt in Part B is expressed rounded to the nearest dollar, \nwhat are the final 3 digits of the amount drawn ?

Repayments start from the 2017 year (i.e. there is no repayment relating to 31 \nDecember 2016). \n \nThe interest rate for the loan is 6% and interest should be calculated on an actual/365 basis. \n \nThe company should account for the debt as follows: \n \nInterest should be expensed through the Profit and Loss accounts as incurred. \n \nThe arrangement fee should be amortized through the Profit and Loss accounts over the life of the \nloan according to the following formula: \no \nAmortization charge in Year N = Fee Charged * [Days in year N for which refinancing debt is \nactive] / [Total number of days across all years for which refinancing debt is active] \n \nOn the Cash Flow Statement, the arrangement fee should be incorporated after the Project \nCashflow line, and it should feed in to the Dividends calculation. \n \nThe project will hold on the balance sheet both the refinancing debt balance, and an asset relating \nto the arrangement fee.\n \nPART B \nYour manager has also asked you to calculate a Debt Service Cover Ratio (“DSCR”) for the refinancing \ndebt to show how much buffer the project has in its cashflows above the amount required to pay the \ninterest and repayments for the refinancing debt. \n \nIn each year that the refinanced loan is active (excluding 2016) this DSCR should be calculated as: \n \nNumerator: \nProject cashflow (as displayed on the Cash Flow Statement) \nApportioned for the number of days in the year that falls within the term of the refinancing debt. \n \nDenominator: \nInterest and Principal Repayments made for the refinancing debt during the year. \n \nYou will also need to calculate a minimum and average DSCR.  The minimum DSCR should be the \nminimum of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt, and the average DSCR should be the \naverage of all the DSCRs over the term of the refinancing debt.   \n \nYou should answer question 6 before proceeding with the remainder of Part B. \n \nOn seeing the minimum DSCR that the project achieves, your manager tells you that this is higher than \nthe banks require – they are willing to lend money to the project as long as the DSCR remains at or above \n1.80 in each year.  As the DSCR is well above this level, the project could afford to make larger \nrepayments in each period, and therefore the initial drawdown could have been larger. \n \nYour manager wishes to amend the model so that as much debt is borrowed as possible given the \nconstraint that the DSCR cannot ever be below 1.80. Any excess amount drawn over and above the \namount needed to repay the existing senior debt and pay the arrangement fee should be distributed \nimmediately to the shareholders. \n \nTo this end, you have been asked to adjust the drawdown amount and the debt repayments (which may \nnow vary independently in each year) so that in each year a DSCR of exactly 1.80 is achieved and the \ndebt is repaid in full on the final repayment date. \n \nQuestions 1 to 6 relate to Part A. \nQuestions 7 to 10 relate to Part B. \n\nQuestion 10 \nWhat is the dividend made to the shareholders on 31 December 2016 in Part B ?

There are three parts to the required analysis:  \nPart 1) Create a full schedule of all 840 data points that MOT collect daily (questions 14 - 15). \nPart 2) Clean up the data provided from the MOT systems (of the actual time) into a form usable for \nanalysis \n(questions 16 - 19). \nPart 3) Answer certain questions put to you by MOT senior management (questions 20 - 24). \nIt is recommended that you read the questions for all parts before beginning your modeling. \n \nBACKGROUND \nThe rail network has 3 lines. These are the Blue line (3 stations), Red line (6 stations) and Yellow line \n(5 stations). All stations feed a central transport hub known as ‘H’. Travel occurs in both directions with \ntwo sets of tracks per line (one track inbound, one track outbound). Travel towards ‘H’ is referred to as \nInbound and traffic away from it as Outbound. The rail network is shown in the diagram.\n \nSCHEDULE \nThe weekday schedule for all three lines is provided below (and is contained in the provided Excel \nworkbook). \nThere are four periods each day when service is provided (AM, Mid, PM and Evening). The frequency \nwithin each period is provided. For example, for the Red Inbound AM service, the first train departs M at \n7am and runs every 20 minutes. Therefore services will depart M at 7:00am, 7:20am, 7:40am, 8:00am, \n8:20am and 8:40am. The first Mid service departs at 9:00am. \nThe times listed are the scheduled departure times from each station (with the exception of the last stop \non each line, which is the scheduled arrival time). \n \nRed - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     M        L        K        J        I        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:10 AM  7:17 AM  7:23 AM  7:29 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:10 AM  9:17 AM  9:23 AM  9:29 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:10 PM  5:17 PM  5:23 PM  5:29 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:10 PM  7:17 PM  7:23 PM  7:29 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:10 PM 11:17 PM 11:23 PM 11:29 PM 11:33 PM\n\nRed - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        I        J        K        L        M\n40                   7:00 AM  7:04 AM  7:10 AM  7:16 AM  7:23 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:04 AM  9:10 AM  9:16 AM  9:23 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:04 PM  5:10 PM  5:16 PM  5:23 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:04 PM  7:10 PM  7:16 PM  7:23 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:04 PM 11:10 PM 11:16 PM 11:23 PM 11:33 PM\n\nYellow - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     Z        Y        X        W        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:12 AM  7:20 AM  7:25 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:12 AM  9:20 AM  9:25 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:12 PM  5:20 PM  5:25 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:12 PM  7:20 PM  7:25 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:12 PM 11:20 PM 11:25 PM 11:28 PM\n\nYellow - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        W        X        Y        Z\n40                   7:00 AM  7:03 AM  7:08 AM  7:16 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:03 AM  9:08 AM  9:16 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:03 PM  5:08 PM  5:16 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:03 PM  7:08 PM  7:16 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:03 PM 11:08 PM 11:16 PM 11:28 PM\n\nBlue - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     A        B        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n\nBlue - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        B        A\n40                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n20                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n \nPART 1 – FULL TRAIN SCHEDULE (QUESTIONS 14 – 15) \nBased on the schedule information provided, complete a full list of all 840 stops scheduled to occur in one \nday. \n \nPART 2 – CLEANING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 16 – 19) \nData has been provided for 5 weekdays (a total of 4,200 data points). Unfortunately, there are a variety of \ndata input methods that can be used and as such the data needs to be put into a standardized format for \nmeaningful analysis to be completed. Each data point is a single cell and contains three fields that must \nbe extracted. These are: \n1) Date. Between 6 and 10 November inclusive. There are two date formats used: for example, \n6 November will be shown as either 6-Nov or 6/Nov. \n2) Time. The actual departure time (or arrival time for the last stop on the line). This is always expressed \nin the same format and includes AM/PM. \n3) Station code. This consists of three letters showing the line, direction of travel and the station the \ndeparture/arrival occurs at (using the first letter of each). \nFor example, a departure on the Red line on the Inbound direction from station K would have the 3 \nletter code RIK. Sometimes there are additional characters in this code (i.e. RIK or R:I:K or R-I-K or \nR/I/K).  \nAdditionally, these three fields can occur in any order.

There are three parts to the required analysis:  \nPart 1) Create a full schedule of all 840 data points that MOT collect daily (questions 14 - 15). \nPart 2) Clean up the data provided from the MOT systems (of the actual time) into a form usable for \nanalysis \n(questions 16 - 19). \nPart 3) Answer certain questions put to you by MOT senior management (questions 20 - 24). \nIt is recommended that you read the questions for all parts before beginning your modeling. \n \nBACKGROUND \nThe rail network has 3 lines. These are the Blue line (3 stations), Red line (6 stations) and Yellow line \n(5 stations). All stations feed a central transport hub known as ‘H’. Travel occurs in both directions with \ntwo sets of tracks per line (one track inbound, one track outbound). Travel towards ‘H’ is referred to as \nInbound and traffic away from it as Outbound. The rail network is shown in the diagram.\n \nSCHEDULE \nThe weekday schedule for all three lines is provided below (and is contained in the provided Excel \nworkbook). \nThere are four periods each day when service is provided (AM, Mid, PM and Evening). The frequency \nwithin each period is provided. For example, for the Red Inbound AM service, the first train departs M at \n7am and runs every 20 minutes. Therefore services will depart M at 7:00am, 7:20am, 7:40am, 8:00am, \n8:20am and 8:40am. The first Mid service departs at 9:00am. \nThe times listed are the scheduled departure times from each station (with the exception of the last stop \non each line, which is the scheduled arrival time). \n \nRed - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     M        L        K        J        I        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:10 AM  7:17 AM  7:23 AM  7:29 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:10 AM  9:17 AM  9:23 AM  9:29 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:10 PM  5:17 PM  5:23 PM  5:29 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:10 PM  7:17 PM  7:23 PM  7:29 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:10 PM 11:17 PM 11:23 PM 11:29 PM 11:33 PM\n\nRed - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        I        J        K        L        M\n40                   7:00 AM  7:04 AM  7:10 AM  7:16 AM  7:23 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:04 AM  9:10 AM  9:16 AM  9:23 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:04 PM  5:10 PM  5:16 PM  5:23 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:04 PM  7:10 PM  7:16 PM  7:23 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:04 PM 11:10 PM 11:16 PM 11:23 PM 11:33 PM\n\nYellow - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     Z        Y        X        W        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:12 AM  7:20 AM  7:25 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:12 AM  9:20 AM  9:25 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:12 PM  5:20 PM  5:25 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:12 PM  7:20 PM  7:25 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:12 PM 11:20 PM 11:25 PM 11:28 PM\n\nYellow - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        W        X        Y        Z\n40                   7:00 AM  7:03 AM  7:08 AM  7:16 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:03 AM  9:08 AM  9:16 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:03 PM  5:08 PM  5:16 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:03 PM  7:08 PM  7:16 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:03 PM 11:08 PM 11:16 PM 11:28 PM\n\nBlue - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     A        B        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n\nBlue - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        B        A\n40                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n20                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n \nPART 1 – FULL TRAIN SCHEDULE (QUESTIONS 14 – 15) \nBased on the schedule information provided, complete a full list of all 840 stops scheduled to occur in one \nday. \n \nPART 2 – CLEANING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 16 – 19) \nData has been provided for 5 weekdays (a total of 4,200 data points). Unfortunately, there are a variety of \ndata input methods that can be used and as such the data needs to be put into a standardized format for \nmeaningful analysis to be completed. Each data point is a single cell and contains three fields that must \nbe extracted. These are: \n1) Date. Between 6 and 10 November inclusive. There are two date formats used: for example, \n6 November will be shown as either 6-Nov or 6/Nov. \n2) Time. The actual departure time (or arrival time for the last stop on the line). This is always expressed \nin the same format and includes AM/PM. \n3) Station code. This consists of three letters showing the line, direction of travel and the station the \ndeparture/arrival occurs at (using the first letter of each). \nFor example, a departure on the Red line on the Inbound direction from station K would have the 3 \nletter code RIK. Sometimes there are additional characters in this code (i.e. RIK or R:I:K or R-I-K or \nR/I/K).  \nAdditionally, these three fields can occur in any order. There is always a single space separating each of \nthe fields. \nPART 3 – ANALYZING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 20 – 24) \nOnce the data is cleaned up, you can compare it against the schedule you calculated in Part 1 to answer \nthese questions.  \n \nFor Questions 14-18, 20-22, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 19, 23- 24, you are required to type in your answer. \n\n \n\nQuestion 15 For one day, what is the total number of stops scheduled for 23 minutes past the hour?

The first Mid service departs at 9:00am. \nThe times listed are the scheduled departure times from each station (with the exception of the last stop \non each line, which is the scheduled arrival time). \n \nRed - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     M        L        K        J        I        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:10 AM  7:17 AM  7:23 AM  7:29 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:10 AM  9:17 AM  9:23 AM  9:29 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:10 PM  5:17 PM  5:23 PM  5:29 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:10 PM  7:17 PM  7:23 PM  7:29 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:10 PM 11:17 PM 11:23 PM 11:29 PM 11:33 PM\n\nRed - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        I        J        K        L        M\n40                   7:00 AM  7:04 AM  7:10 AM  7:16 AM  7:23 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:04 AM  9:10 AM  9:16 AM  9:23 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:04 PM  5:10 PM  5:16 PM  5:23 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:04 PM  7:10 PM  7:16 PM  7:23 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:04 PM 11:10 PM 11:16 PM 11:23 PM 11:33 PM\n\nYellow - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     Z        Y        X        W        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:12 AM  7:20 AM  7:25 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:12 AM  9:20 AM  9:25 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:12 PM  5:20 PM  5:25 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:12 PM  7:20 PM  7:25 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:12 PM 11:20 PM 11:25 PM 11:28 PM\n\nYellow - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        W        X        Y        Z\n40                   7:00 AM  7:03 AM  7:08 AM  7:16 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:03 AM  9:08 AM  9:16 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:03 PM  5:08 PM  5:16 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:03 PM  7:08 PM  7:16 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:03 PM 11:08 PM 11:16 PM 11:28 PM\n\nBlue - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     A        B        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n\nBlue - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        B        A\n40                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n20                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n \nPART 1 – FULL TRAIN SCHEDULE (QUESTIONS 14 – 15) \nBased on the schedule information provided, complete a full list of all 840 stops scheduled to occur in one \nday. \n \nPART 2 – CLEANING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 16 – 19) \nData has been provided for 5 weekdays (a total of 4,200 data points). Unfortunately, there are a variety of \ndata input methods that can be used and as such the data needs to be put into a standardized format for \nmeaningful analysis to be completed. Each data point is a single cell and contains three fields that must \nbe extracted. These are: \n1) Date. Between 6 and 10 November inclusive. There are two date formats used: for example, \n6 November will be shown as either 6-Nov or 6/Nov. \n2) Time. The actual departure time (or arrival time for the last stop on the line). This is always expressed \nin the same format and includes AM/PM. \n3) Station code. This consists of three letters showing the line, direction of travel and the station the \ndeparture/arrival occurs at (using the first letter of each). \nFor example, a departure on the Red line on the Inbound direction from station K would have the 3 \nletter code RIK. Sometimes there are additional characters in this code (i.e. RIK or R:I:K or R-I-K or \nR/I/K).  \nAdditionally, these three fields can occur in any order. There is always a single space separating each of \nthe fields. \nPART 3 – ANALYZING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 20 – 24) \nOnce the data is cleaned up, you can compare it against the schedule you calculated in Part 1 to answer \nthese questions.  \n \nFor Questions 14-18, 20-22, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 19, 23- 24, you are required to type in your answer. \n\n \n\nQuestion 16 On the 6th November, the Red line Inbound was scheduled to arrive at station J at 8:43 a.m. When did this service actually arrive?

There are three parts to the required analysis:  \nPart 1) Create a full schedule of all 840 data points that MOT collect daily (questions 14 - 15). \nPart 2) Clean up the data provided from the MOT systems (of the actual time) into a form usable for \nanalysis \n(questions 16 - 19). \nPart 3) Answer certain questions put to you by MOT senior management (questions 20 - 24). \nIt is recommended that you read the questions for all parts before beginning your modeling. \n \nBACKGROUND \nThe rail network has 3 lines. These are the Blue line (3 stations), Red line (6 stations) and Yellow line \n(5 stations). All stations feed a central transport hub known as ‘H’. Travel occurs in both directions with \ntwo sets of tracks per line (one track inbound, one track outbound). Travel towards ‘H’ is referred to as \nInbound and traffic away from it as Outbound. The rail network is shown in the diagram.\n \nSCHEDULE \nThe weekday schedule for all three lines is provided below (and is contained in the provided Excel \nworkbook). \nThere are four periods each day when service is provided (AM, Mid, PM and Evening). The frequency \nwithin each period is provided. For example, for the Red Inbound AM service, the first train departs M at \n7am and runs every 20 minutes. Therefore services will depart M at 7:00am, 7:20am, 7:40am, 8:00am, \n8:20am and 8:40am. The first Mid service departs at 9:00am. \nThe times listed are the scheduled departure times from each station (with the exception of the last stop \non each line, which is the scheduled arrival time). \n \nRed - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     M        L        K        J        I        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:10 AM  7:17 AM  7:23 AM  7:29 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:10 AM  9:17 AM  9:23 AM  9:29 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:10 PM  5:17 PM  5:23 PM  5:29 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:10 PM  7:17 PM  7:23 PM  7:29 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:10 PM 11:17 PM 11:23 PM 11:29 PM 11:33 PM\n\nRed - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        I        J        K        L        M\n40                   7:00 AM  7:04 AM  7:10 AM  7:16 AM  7:23 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:04 AM  9:10 AM  9:16 AM  9:23 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:04 PM  5:10 PM  5:16 PM  5:23 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:04 PM  7:10 PM  7:16 PM  7:23 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:04 PM 11:10 PM 11:16 PM 11:23 PM 11:33 PM\n\nYellow - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     Z        Y        X        W        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:12 AM  7:20 AM  7:25 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:12 AM  9:20 AM  9:25 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:12 PM  5:20 PM  5:25 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:12 PM  7:20 PM  7:25 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:12 PM 11:20 PM 11:25 PM 11:28 PM\n\nYellow - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        W        X        Y        Z\n40                   7:00 AM  7:03 AM  7:08 AM  7:16 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:03 AM  9:08 AM  9:16 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:03 PM  5:08 PM  5:16 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:03 PM  7:08 PM  7:16 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:03 PM 11:08 PM 11:16 PM 11:28 PM\n\nBlue - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     A        B        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n\nBlue - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        B        A\n40                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n20                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n \nPART 1 – FULL TRAIN SCHEDULE (QUESTIONS 14 – 15) \nBased on the schedule information provided, complete a full list of all 840 stops scheduled to occur in one \nday. \n \nPART 2 – CLEANING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 16 – 19) \nData has been provided for 5 weekdays (a total of 4,200 data points).

There are three parts to the required analysis:  \nPart 1) Create a full schedule of all 840 data points that MOT collect daily (questions 14 - 15). \nPart 2) Clean up the data provided from the MOT systems (of the actual time) into a form usable for \nanalysis \n(questions 16 - 19). \nPart 3) Answer certain questions put to you by MOT senior management (questions 20 - 24). \nIt is recommended that you read the questions for all parts before beginning your modeling. \n \nBACKGROUND \nThe rail network has 3 lines. These are the Blue line (3 stations), Red line (6 stations) and Yellow line \n(5 stations). All stations feed a central transport hub known as ‘H’. Travel occurs in both directions with \ntwo sets of tracks per line (one track inbound, one track outbound). Travel towards ‘H’ is referred to as \nInbound and traffic away from it as Outbound. The rail network is shown in the diagram.\n \nSCHEDULE \nThe weekday schedule for all three lines is provided below (and is contained in the provided Excel \nworkbook). \nThere are four periods each day when service is provided (AM, Mid, PM and Evening). The frequency \nwithin each period is provided. For example, for the Red Inbound AM service, the first train departs M at \n7am and runs every 20 minutes. Therefore services will depart M at 7:00am, 7:20am, 7:40am, 8:00am, \n8:20am and 8:40am. The first Mid service departs at 9:00am. \nThe times listed are the scheduled departure times from each station (with the exception of the last stop \non each line, which is the scheduled arrival time). \n \nRed - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     M        L        K        J        I        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:10 AM  7:17 AM  7:23 AM  7:29 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:10 AM  9:17 AM  9:23 AM  9:29 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:10 PM  5:17 PM  5:23 PM  5:29 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:10 PM  7:17 PM  7:23 PM  7:29 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:10 PM 11:17 PM 11:23 PM 11:29 PM 11:33 PM\n\nRed - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        I        J        K        L        M\n40                   7:00 AM  7:04 AM  7:10 AM  7:16 AM  7:23 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:04 AM  9:10 AM  9:16 AM  9:23 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:04 PM  5:10 PM  5:16 PM  5:23 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:04 PM  7:10 PM  7:16 PM  7:23 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:04 PM 11:10 PM 11:16 PM 11:23 PM 11:33 PM\n\nYellow - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     Z        Y        X        W        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:12 AM  7:20 AM  7:25 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:12 AM  9:20 AM  9:25 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:12 PM  5:20 PM  5:25 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:12 PM  7:20 PM  7:25 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:12 PM 11:20 PM 11:25 PM 11:28 PM\n\nYellow - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        W        X        Y        Z\n40                   7:00 AM  7:03 AM  7:08 AM  7:16 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:03 AM  9:08 AM  9:16 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:03 PM  5:08 PM  5:16 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:03 PM  7:08 PM  7:16 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:03 PM 11:08 PM 11:16 PM 11:28 PM\n\nBlue - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     A        B        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n\nBlue - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        B        A\n40                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n20                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n \nPART 1 – FULL TRAIN SCHEDULE (QUESTIONS 14 – 15) \nBased on the schedule information provided, complete a full list of all 840 stops scheduled to occur in one \nday. \n \nPART 2 – CLEANING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 16 – 19) \nData has been provided for 5 weekdays (a total of 4,200 data points). Unfortunately, there are a variety of \ndata input methods that can be used and as such the data needs to be put into a standardized format for \nmeaningful analysis to be completed. Each data point is a single cell and contains three fields that must \nbe extracted. These are: \n1) Date. Between 6 and 10 November inclusive. There are two date formats used: for example, \n6 November will be shown as either 6-Nov or 6/Nov. \n2) Time. The actual departure time (or arrival time for the last stop on the line). This is always expressed \nin the same format and includes AM/PM. \n3) Station code. This consists of three letters showing the line, direction of travel and the station the \ndeparture/arrival occurs at (using the first letter of each). \nFor example, a departure on the Red line on the Inbound direction from station K would have the 3 \nletter code RIK. Sometimes there are additional characters in this code (i.e. RIK or R:I:K or R-I-K or \nR/I/K).  \nAdditionally, these three fields can occur in any order. There is always a single space separating each of \nthe fields. \nPART 3 – ANALYZING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 20 – 24) \nOnce the data is cleaned up, you can compare it against the schedule you calculated in Part 1 to answer \nthese questions.  \n \nFor Questions 14-18, 20-22, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 19, 23- 24, you are required to type in your answer. \n\n \n\nQuestion 18 What is the earliest departure time of any service on the 9th of November?

The first Mid service departs at 9:00am. \nThe times listed are the scheduled departure times from each station (with the exception of the last stop \non each line, which is the scheduled arrival time). \n \nRed - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     M        L        K        J        I        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:10 AM  7:17 AM  7:23 AM  7:29 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:10 AM  9:17 AM  9:23 AM  9:29 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:10 PM  5:17 PM  5:23 PM  5:29 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:10 PM  7:17 PM  7:23 PM  7:29 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:10 PM 11:17 PM 11:23 PM 11:29 PM 11:33 PM\n\nRed - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        I        J        K        L        M\n40                   7:00 AM  7:04 AM  7:10 AM  7:16 AM  7:23 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:04 AM  9:10 AM  9:16 AM  9:23 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:04 PM  5:10 PM  5:16 PM  5:23 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:04 PM  7:10 PM  7:16 PM  7:23 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:04 PM 11:10 PM 11:16 PM 11:23 PM 11:33 PM\n\nYellow - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     Z        Y        X        W        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:12 AM  7:20 AM  7:25 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:12 AM  9:20 AM  9:25 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:12 PM  5:20 PM  5:25 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:12 PM  7:20 PM  7:25 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:12 PM 11:20 PM 11:25 PM 11:28 PM\n\nYellow - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        W        X        Y        Z\n40                   7:00 AM  7:03 AM  7:08 AM  7:16 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:03 AM  9:08 AM  9:16 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:03 PM  5:08 PM  5:16 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:03 PM  7:08 PM  7:16 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:03 PM 11:08 PM 11:16 PM 11:28 PM\n\nBlue - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     A        B        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n\nBlue - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        B        A\n40                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n20                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n \nPART 1 – FULL TRAIN SCHEDULE (QUESTIONS 14 – 15) \nBased on the schedule information provided, complete a full list of all 840 stops scheduled to occur in one \nday. \n \nPART 2 – CLEANING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 16 – 19) \nData has been provided for 5 weekdays (a total of 4,200 data points). Unfortunately, there are a variety of \ndata input methods that can be used and as such the data needs to be put into a standardized format for \nmeaningful analysis to be completed. Each data point is a single cell and contains three fields that must \nbe extracted. These are: \n1) Date. Between 6 and 10 November inclusive. There are two date formats used: for example, \n6 November will be shown as either 6-Nov or 6/Nov. \n2) Time. The actual departure time (or arrival time for the last stop on the line). This is always expressed \nin the same format and includes AM/PM. \n3) Station code. This consists of three letters showing the line, direction of travel and the station the \ndeparture/arrival occurs at (using the first letter of each). \nFor example, a departure on the Red line on the Inbound direction from station K would have the 3 \nletter code RIK. Sometimes there are additional characters in this code (i.e. RIK or R:I:K or R-I-K or \nR/I/K).  \nAdditionally, these three fields can occur in any order. There is always a single space separating each of \nthe fields. \nPART 3 – ANALYZING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 20 – 24) \nOnce the data is cleaned up, you can compare it against the schedule you calculated in Part 1 to answer \nthese questions.  \n \nFor Questions 14-18, 20-22, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 19, 23- 24, you are required to type in your answer. \n\n \n\nQuestion 19 On the 8th of November, what was the total length of time (in minutes) of the first Outbound service on the Yellow line?

There are three parts to the required analysis:  \nPart 1) Create a full schedule of all 840 data points that MOT collect daily (questions 14 - 15). \nPart 2) Clean up the data provided from the MOT systems (of the actual time) into a form usable for \nanalysis \n(questions 16 - 19). \nPart 3) Answer certain questions put to you by MOT senior management (questions 20 - 24). \nIt is recommended that you read the questions for all parts before beginning your modeling. \n \nBACKGROUND \nThe rail network has 3 lines. These are the Blue line (3 stations), Red line (6 stations) and Yellow line \n(5 stations). All stations feed a central transport hub known as ‘H’. Travel occurs in both directions with \ntwo sets of tracks per line (one track inbound, one track outbound). Travel towards ‘H’ is referred to as \nInbound and traffic away from it as Outbound. The rail network is shown in the diagram.\n \nSCHEDULE \nThe weekday schedule for all three lines is provided below (and is contained in the provided Excel \nworkbook). \nThere are four periods each day when service is provided (AM, Mid, PM and Evening). The frequency \nwithin each period is provided. For example, for the Red Inbound AM service, the first train departs M at \n7am and runs every 20 minutes. Therefore services will depart M at 7:00am, 7:20am, 7:40am, 8:00am, \n8:20am and 8:40am. The first Mid service departs at 9:00am. \nThe times listed are the scheduled departure times from each station (with the exception of the last stop \non each line, which is the scheduled arrival time). \n \nRed - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     M        L        K        J        I        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:10 AM  7:17 AM  7:23 AM  7:29 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:10 AM  9:17 AM  9:23 AM  9:29 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:10 PM  5:17 PM  5:23 PM  5:29 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:10 PM  7:17 PM  7:23 PM  7:29 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:10 PM 11:17 PM 11:23 PM 11:29 PM 11:33 PM\n\nRed - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        I        J        K        L        M\n40                   7:00 AM  7:04 AM  7:10 AM  7:16 AM  7:23 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:04 AM  9:10 AM  9:16 AM  9:23 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:04 PM  5:10 PM  5:16 PM  5:23 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:04 PM  7:10 PM  7:16 PM  7:23 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:04 PM 11:10 PM 11:16 PM 11:23 PM 11:33 PM\n\nYellow - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     Z        Y        X        W        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:12 AM  7:20 AM  7:25 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:12 AM  9:20 AM  9:25 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:12 PM  5:20 PM  5:25 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:12 PM  7:20 PM  7:25 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:12 PM 11:20 PM 11:25 PM 11:28 PM\n\nYellow - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        W        X        Y        Z\n40                   7:00 AM  7:03 AM  7:08 AM  7:16 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:03 AM  9:08 AM  9:16 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:03 PM  5:08 PM  5:16 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:03 PM  7:08 PM  7:16 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:03 PM 11:08 PM 11:16 PM 11:28 PM\n\nBlue - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     A        B        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n\nBlue - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        B        A\n40                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n20                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n \nPART 1 – FULL TRAIN SCHEDULE (QUESTIONS 14 – 15) \nBased on the schedule information provided, complete a full list of all 840 stops scheduled to occur in one \nday. \n \nPART 2 – CLEANING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 16 – 19) \nData has been provided for 5 weekdays (a total of 4,200 data points).

There are three parts to the required analysis:  \nPart 1) Create a full schedule of all 840 data points that MOT collect daily (questions 14 - 15). \nPart 2) Clean up the data provided from the MOT systems (of the actual time) into a form usable for \nanalysis \n(questions 16 - 19). \nPart 3) Answer certain questions put to you by MOT senior management (questions 20 - 24). \nIt is recommended that you read the questions for all parts before beginning your modeling. \n \nBACKGROUND \nThe rail network has 3 lines. These are the Blue line (3 stations), Red line (6 stations) and Yellow line \n(5 stations). All stations feed a central transport hub known as ‘H’. Travel occurs in both directions with \ntwo sets of tracks per line (one track inbound, one track outbound). Travel towards ‘H’ is referred to as \nInbound and traffic away from it as Outbound. The rail network is shown in the diagram.\n \nSCHEDULE \nThe weekday schedule for all three lines is provided below (and is contained in the provided Excel \nworkbook). \nThere are four periods each day when service is provided (AM, Mid, PM and Evening). The frequency \nwithin each period is provided. For example, for the Red Inbound AM service, the first train departs M at \n7am and runs every 20 minutes. Therefore services will depart M at 7:00am, 7:20am, 7:40am, 8:00am, \n8:20am and 8:40am. The first Mid service departs at 9:00am. \nThe times listed are the scheduled departure times from each station (with the exception of the last stop \non each line, which is the scheduled arrival time). \n \nRed - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     M        L        K        J        I        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:10 AM  7:17 AM  7:23 AM  7:29 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:10 AM  9:17 AM  9:23 AM  9:29 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:10 PM  5:17 PM  5:23 PM  5:29 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:10 PM  7:17 PM  7:23 PM  7:29 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:10 PM 11:17 PM 11:23 PM 11:29 PM 11:33 PM\n\nRed - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        I        J        K        L        M\n40                   7:00 AM  7:04 AM  7:10 AM  7:16 AM  7:23 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:04 AM  9:10 AM  9:16 AM  9:23 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:04 PM  5:10 PM  5:16 PM  5:23 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:04 PM  7:10 PM  7:16 PM  7:23 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:04 PM 11:10 PM 11:16 PM 11:23 PM 11:33 PM\n\nYellow - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     Z        Y        X        W        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:12 AM  7:20 AM  7:25 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:12 AM  9:20 AM  9:25 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:12 PM  5:20 PM  5:25 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:12 PM  7:20 PM  7:25 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:12 PM 11:20 PM 11:25 PM 11:28 PM\n\nYellow - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        W        X        Y        Z\n40                   7:00 AM  7:03 AM  7:08 AM  7:16 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:03 AM  9:08 AM  9:16 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:03 PM  5:08 PM  5:16 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:03 PM  7:08 PM  7:16 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:03 PM 11:08 PM 11:16 PM 11:28 PM\n\nBlue - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     A        B        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n\nBlue - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        B        A\n40                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n20                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n \nPART 1 – FULL TRAIN SCHEDULE (QUESTIONS 14 – 15) \nBased on the schedule information provided, complete a full list of all 840 stops scheduled to occur in one \nday. \n \nPART 2 – CLEANING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 16 – 19) \nData has been provided for 5 weekdays (a total of 4,200 data points). Unfortunately, there are a variety of \ndata input methods that can be used and as such the data needs to be put into a standardized format for \nmeaningful analysis to be completed. Each data point is a single cell and contains three fields that must \nbe extracted. These are: \n1) Date. Between 6 and 10 November inclusive. There are two date formats used: for example, \n6 November will be shown as either 6-Nov or 6/Nov. \n2) Time. The actual departure time (or arrival time for the last stop on the line). This is always expressed \nin the same format and includes AM/PM. \n3) Station code. This consists of three letters showing the line, direction of travel and the station the \ndeparture/arrival occurs at (using the first letter of each). \nFor example, a departure on the Red line on the Inbound direction from station K would have the 3 \nletter code RIK. Sometimes there are additional characters in this code (i.e. RIK or R:I:K or R-I-K or \nR/I/K).  \nAdditionally, these three fields can occur in any order. There is always a single space separating each of \nthe fields. \nPART 3 – ANALYZING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 20 – 24) \nOnce the data is cleaned up, you can compare it against the schedule you calculated in Part 1 to answer \nthese questions.  \n \nFor Questions 14-18, 20-22, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 19, 23- 24, you are required to type in your answer. \n\n \n\nQuestion 21 On the 10th of November on the blue line, how many departures/arrivals were ahead of schedule?

The first Mid service departs at 9:00am. \nThe times listed are the scheduled departure times from each station (with the exception of the last stop \non each line, which is the scheduled arrival time). \n \nRed - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     M        L        K        J        I        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:10 AM  7:17 AM  7:23 AM  7:29 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:10 AM  9:17 AM  9:23 AM  9:29 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:10 PM  5:17 PM  5:23 PM  5:29 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:10 PM  7:17 PM  7:23 PM  7:29 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:10 PM 11:17 PM 11:23 PM 11:29 PM 11:33 PM\n\nRed - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        I        J        K        L        M\n40                   7:00 AM  7:04 AM  7:10 AM  7:16 AM  7:23 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:04 AM  9:10 AM  9:16 AM  9:23 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:04 PM  5:10 PM  5:16 PM  5:23 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:04 PM  7:10 PM  7:16 PM  7:23 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:04 PM 11:10 PM 11:16 PM 11:23 PM 11:33 PM\n\nYellow - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     Z        Y        X        W        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:12 AM  7:20 AM  7:25 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:12 AM  9:20 AM  9:25 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:12 PM  5:20 PM  5:25 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:12 PM  7:20 PM  7:25 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:12 PM 11:20 PM 11:25 PM 11:28 PM\n\nYellow - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        W        X        Y        Z\n40                   7:00 AM  7:03 AM  7:08 AM  7:16 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:03 AM  9:08 AM  9:16 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:03 PM  5:08 PM  5:16 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:03 PM  7:08 PM  7:16 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:03 PM 11:08 PM 11:16 PM 11:28 PM\n\nBlue - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     A        B        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n\nBlue - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        B        A\n40                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n20                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n \nPART 1 – FULL TRAIN SCHEDULE (QUESTIONS 14 – 15) \nBased on the schedule information provided, complete a full list of all 840 stops scheduled to occur in one \nday. \n \nPART 2 – CLEANING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 16 – 19) \nData has been provided for 5 weekdays (a total of 4,200 data points). Unfortunately, there are a variety of \ndata input methods that can be used and as such the data needs to be put into a standardized format for \nmeaningful analysis to be completed. Each data point is a single cell and contains three fields that must \nbe extracted. These are: \n1) Date. Between 6 and 10 November inclusive. There are two date formats used: for example, \n6 November will be shown as either 6-Nov or 6/Nov. \n2) Time. The actual departure time (or arrival time for the last stop on the line). This is always expressed \nin the same format and includes AM/PM. \n3) Station code. This consists of three letters showing the line, direction of travel and the station the \ndeparture/arrival occurs at (using the first letter of each). \nFor example, a departure on the Red line on the Inbound direction from station K would have the 3 \nletter code RIK. Sometimes there are additional characters in this code (i.e. RIK or R:I:K or R-I-K or \nR/I/K).  \nAdditionally, these three fields can occur in any order. There is always a single space separating each of \nthe fields. \nPART 3 – ANALYZING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 20 – 24) \nOnce the data is cleaned up, you can compare it against the schedule you calculated in Part 1 to answer \nthese questions.  \n \nFor Questions 14-18, 20-22, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 19, 23- 24, you are required to type in your answer. \n\n \n\nQuestion 22 Which of the following stops had the highest average difference between the scheduled arrival time and the actual arrival time over the 5 days? (Average is calculated as the mean of the differences, you should not take the absolute value of the differences) [5 marks] A. RIH B. ROM C. YIH D. YOZ E. BIH F. BOA

There are three parts to the required analysis:  \nPart 1) Create a full schedule of all 840 data points that MOT collect daily (questions 14 - 15). \nPart 2) Clean up the data provided from the MOT systems (of the actual time) into a form usable for \nanalysis \n(questions 16 - 19). \nPart 3) Answer certain questions put to you by MOT senior management (questions 20 - 24). \nIt is recommended that you read the questions for all parts before beginning your modeling. \n \nBACKGROUND \nThe rail network has 3 lines. These are the Blue line (3 stations), Red line (6 stations) and Yellow line \n(5 stations). All stations feed a central transport hub known as ‘H’. Travel occurs in both directions with \ntwo sets of tracks per line (one track inbound, one track outbound). Travel towards ‘H’ is referred to as \nInbound and traffic away from it as Outbound. The rail network is shown in the diagram.\n \nSCHEDULE \nThe weekday schedule for all three lines is provided below (and is contained in the provided Excel \nworkbook). \nThere are four periods each day when service is provided (AM, Mid, PM and Evening). The frequency \nwithin each period is provided. For example, for the Red Inbound AM service, the first train departs M at \n7am and runs every 20 minutes. Therefore services will depart M at 7:00am, 7:20am, 7:40am, 8:00am, \n8:20am and 8:40am. The first Mid service departs at 9:00am. \nThe times listed are the scheduled departure times from each station (with the exception of the last stop \non each line, which is the scheduled arrival time). \n \nRed - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     M        L        K        J        I        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:10 AM  7:17 AM  7:23 AM  7:29 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:10 AM  9:17 AM  9:23 AM  9:29 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:10 PM  5:17 PM  5:23 PM  5:29 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:10 PM  7:17 PM  7:23 PM  7:29 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:10 PM 11:17 PM 11:23 PM 11:29 PM 11:33 PM\n\nRed - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        I        J        K        L        M\n40                   7:00 AM  7:04 AM  7:10 AM  7:16 AM  7:23 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:04 AM  9:10 AM  9:16 AM  9:23 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:04 PM  5:10 PM  5:16 PM  5:23 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:04 PM  7:10 PM  7:16 PM  7:23 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:04 PM 11:10 PM 11:16 PM 11:23 PM 11:33 PM\n\nYellow - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     Z        Y        X        W        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:12 AM  7:20 AM  7:25 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:12 AM  9:20 AM  9:25 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:12 PM  5:20 PM  5:25 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:12 PM  7:20 PM  7:25 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:12 PM 11:20 PM 11:25 PM 11:28 PM\n\nYellow - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        W        X        Y        Z\n40                   7:00 AM  7:03 AM  7:08 AM  7:16 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:03 AM  9:08 AM  9:16 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:03 PM  5:08 PM  5:16 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:03 PM  7:08 PM  7:16 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:03 PM 11:08 PM 11:16 PM 11:28 PM\n\nBlue - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     A        B        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n\nBlue - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        B        A\n40                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n20                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n \nPART 1 – FULL TRAIN SCHEDULE (QUESTIONS 14 – 15) \nBased on the schedule information provided, complete a full list of all 840 stops scheduled to occur in one \nday. \n \nPART 2 – CLEANING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 16 – 19) \nData has been provided for 5 weekdays (a total of 4,200 data points).

There are three parts to the required analysis:  \nPart 1) Create a full schedule of all 840 data points that MOT collect daily (questions 14 - 15). \nPart 2) Clean up the data provided from the MOT systems (of the actual time) into a form usable for \nanalysis \n(questions 16 - 19). \nPart 3) Answer certain questions put to you by MOT senior management (questions 20 - 24). \nIt is recommended that you read the questions for all parts before beginning your modeling. \n \nBACKGROUND \nThe rail network has 3 lines. These are the Blue line (3 stations), Red line (6 stations) and Yellow line \n(5 stations). All stations feed a central transport hub known as ‘H’. Travel occurs in both directions with \ntwo sets of tracks per line (one track inbound, one track outbound). Travel towards ‘H’ is referred to as \nInbound and traffic away from it as Outbound. The rail network is shown in the diagram.\n \nSCHEDULE \nThe weekday schedule for all three lines is provided below (and is contained in the provided Excel \nworkbook). \nThere are four periods each day when service is provided (AM, Mid, PM and Evening). The frequency \nwithin each period is provided. For example, for the Red Inbound AM service, the first train departs M at \n7am and runs every 20 minutes. Therefore services will depart M at 7:00am, 7:20am, 7:40am, 8:00am, \n8:20am and 8:40am. The first Mid service departs at 9:00am. \nThe times listed are the scheduled departure times from each station (with the exception of the last stop \non each line, which is the scheduled arrival time). \n \nRed - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     M        L        K        J        I        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:10 AM  7:17 AM  7:23 AM  7:29 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:10 AM  9:17 AM  9:23 AM  9:29 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:10 PM  5:17 PM  5:23 PM  5:29 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:10 PM  7:17 PM  7:23 PM  7:29 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:10 PM 11:17 PM 11:23 PM 11:29 PM 11:33 PM\n\nRed - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        I        J        K        L        M\n40                   7:00 AM  7:04 AM  7:10 AM  7:16 AM  7:23 AM  7:33 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:04 AM  9:10 AM  9:16 AM  9:23 AM  9:33 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:04 PM  5:10 PM  5:16 PM  5:23 PM  5:33 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:04 PM  7:10 PM  7:16 PM  7:23 PM  7:33 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:04 PM 11:10 PM 11:16 PM 11:23 PM 11:33 PM\n\nYellow - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     Z        Y        X        W        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:12 AM  7:20 AM  7:25 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:12 AM  9:20 AM  9:25 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:12 PM  5:20 PM  5:25 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:12 PM  7:20 PM  7:25 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:12 PM 11:20 PM 11:25 PM 11:28 PM\n\nYellow - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        W        X        Y        Z\n40                   7:00 AM  7:03 AM  7:08 AM  7:16 AM  7:28 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:03 AM  9:08 AM  9:16 AM  9:28 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:03 PM  5:08 PM  5:16 PM  5:28 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:03 PM  7:08 PM  7:16 PM  7:28 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:03 PM 11:08 PM 11:16 PM 11:28 PM\n\nBlue - Inbound\nFrequency (mins)     A        B        H\n20                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n40                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n\nBlue - Outbound\nFrequency (mins)     H        B        A\n40                   7:00 AM  7:08 AM  7:24 AM\n30                   9:00 AM  9:08 AM  9:24 AM\n20                   5:00 PM  5:08 PM  5:24 PM\n60                   7:00 PM  7:08 PM  7:24 PM\nFinal service       11:00 PM 11:08 PM 11:24 PM\n \nPART 1 – FULL TRAIN SCHEDULE (QUESTIONS 14 – 15) \nBased on the schedule information provided, complete a full list of all 840 stops scheduled to occur in one \nday. \n \nPART 2 – CLEANING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 16 – 19) \nData has been provided for 5 weekdays (a total of 4,200 data points). Unfortunately, there are a variety of \ndata input methods that can be used and as such the data needs to be put into a standardized format for \nmeaningful analysis to be completed. Each data point is a single cell and contains three fields that must \nbe extracted. These are: \n1) Date. Between 6 and 10 November inclusive. There are two date formats used: for example, \n6 November will be shown as either 6-Nov or 6/Nov. \n2) Time. The actual departure time (or arrival time for the last stop on the line). This is always expressed \nin the same format and includes AM/PM. \n3) Station code. This consists of three letters showing the line, direction of travel and the station the \ndeparture/arrival occurs at (using the first letter of each). \nFor example, a departure on the Red line on the Inbound direction from station K would have the 3 \nletter code RIK. Sometimes there are additional characters in this code (i.e. RIK or R:I:K or R-I-K or \nR/I/K).  \nAdditionally, these three fields can occur in any order. There is always a single space separating each of \nthe fields. \nPART 3 – ANALYZING THE DATA (QUESTIONS 20 – 24) \nOnce the data is cleaned up, you can compare it against the schedule you calculated in Part 1 to answer \nthese questions.  \n \nFor Questions 14-18, 20-22, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 19, 23- 24, you are required to type in your answer. \n\n \n\nQuestion 24 What was the longest a trip took (in minutes) on the Yellow line in either direction over the 5 days? (i.e. from H-Z or Z-H) [5 marks]

company that has 8 customers (Company A – \nCompany H), all with very specific payment terms. No expense calculations are required. \nThe questions all relate to the 2018 calendar year, but you may need to model before/after this period to \naccurately calculate the cash forecast (calculations should include the relevant days in 2017 and 2019 \nwhere the payment methodology requires it).  \nDo not round your answers at any stage in the model. \nA weekday is defined as a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. A weekend is defined as \nSaturday and Sunday. There are no holidays to consider. \nYou have been provided with an excel workbook file with the ModelOff formatting to use. This file contains \nnone of the inputs provided below – you will need to input these yourself. \n \nCOMPANY A \nCompany A pays a monthly figure of $17.3m. This is paid in 4 segments each month – 11% on day 5, \n21% on day 10, 41% on day 18 and the balance on day 23. Payments are made on the days specified \neven if it is a weekend. \n \nCOMPANY B \nCompany B has a daily charge of $0.35m that accrues daily. The accrued balance is paid monthly on the \nthird Thursday of the month. \nFor example, the payment for January 2018 has accruals from the third Friday in December 2017 until the \nthird Thursday in January 2018 (inclusive). \n \nCOMPANY C \nCompany has a daily charge of $0.18m per day. On weekdays the charge is paid on the same day, on the \nweekends it accrues and is paid on the Monday. \n \nCOMPANY D \nCompany D has a daily charge of $0.23m. This is paid once per month on the 15th. The monthly payment \nis based on the number of days in that calendar month. Payments are made on the day specified even if it \nis a weekend. \n \nCOMPANY E \nThe total monthly charge for Company E is calculated based on the number of Tuesdays in the month at a \nrate of $1.96m per Tuesday. This is paid evenly across all the weekdays of that month. \nRound 2 Section 1 - Case Study Information Pack \n\nCOMPANY F \nCompany F makes 3 payments per month, each of $5.34m. They are paid on the 7th, 14th and 20th of the \nmonth. However, if the payment date is a weekend, it is instead paid on the Friday before the weekend. \n \nCOMPANY G \nCompany G makes a single monthly payment of $9.23m. On even months (February, April etc) it is paid \non the first weekday of the month. On odd months (January, March etc), it is paid on the third weekday of \nthe month. \n \nCOMPANY H \nCompany H makes a payment of $1.79m every Wednesday. However, if the payment falls on the first 10 \ndays of the month it is instead paid 1 day earlier.

that has 8 customers (Company A – \nCompany H), all with very specific payment terms. No expense calculations are required. \nThe questions all relate to the 2018 calendar year, but you may need to model before/after this period to \naccurately calculate the cash forecast (calculations should include the relevant days in 2017 and 2019 \nwhere the payment methodology requires it).  \nDo not round your answers at any stage in the model. \nA weekday is defined as a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. A weekend is defined as \nSaturday and Sunday. There are no holidays to consider. \nYou have been provided with an excel workbook file with the ModelOff formatting to use. This file contains \nnone of the inputs provided below – you will need to input these yourself. \n \nCOMPANY A \nCompany A pays a monthly figure of $17.3m. This is paid in 4 segments each month – 11% on day 5, \n21% on day 10, 41% on day 18 and the balance on day 23. Payments are made on the days specified \neven if it is a weekend. \n \nCOMPANY B \nCompany B has a daily charge of $0.35m that accrues daily. The accrued balance is paid monthly on the \nthird Thursday of the month. \nFor example, the payment for January 2018 has accruals from the third Friday in December 2017 until the \nthird Thursday in January 2018 (inclusive). \n \nCOMPANY C \nCompany has a daily charge of $0.18m per day. On weekdays the charge is paid on the same day, on the \nweekends it accrues and is paid on the Monday. \n \nCOMPANY D \nCompany D has a daily charge of $0.23m. This is paid once per month on the 15th. The monthly payment \nis based on the number of days in that calendar month. Payments are made on the day specified even if it \nis a weekend. \n \nCOMPANY E \nThe total monthly charge for Company E is calculated based on the number of Tuesdays in the month at a \nrate of $1.96m per Tuesday. This is paid evenly across all the weekdays of that month. \nRound 2 Section 1 - Case Study Information Pack \n\nCOMPANY F \nCompany F makes 3 payments per month, each of $5.34m. They are paid on the 7th, 14th and 20th of the \nmonth. However, if the payment date is a weekend, it is instead paid on the Friday before the weekend. \n \nCOMPANY G \nCompany G makes a single monthly payment of $9.23m. On even months (February, April etc) it is paid \non the first weekday of the month. On odd months (January, March etc), it is paid on the third weekday of \nthe month. \n \nCOMPANY H \nCompany H makes a payment of $1.79m every Wednesday. However, if the payment falls on the first 10 \ndays of the month it is instead paid 1 day earlier. If the payment falls on the last 10 days of the month, it is \ninstead paid one day later.\n \nFor Questions 1 – 9, 11, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 10 and 12, you are required to type in your answer.\n\nQuestion 2 What is the cash received in $m from Company B between the months of Apr 2018 and Oct 2018 (inclusive)?

a company that has 8 customers (Company A – \nCompany H), all with very specific payment terms. No expense calculations are required. \nThe questions all relate to the 2018 calendar year, but you may need to model before/after this period to \naccurately calculate the cash forecast (calculations should include the relevant days in 2017 and 2019 \nwhere the payment methodology requires it).  \nDo not round your answers at any stage in the model. \nA weekday is defined as a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. A weekend is defined as \nSaturday and Sunday. There are no holidays to consider. \nYou have been provided with an excel workbook file with the ModelOff formatting to use. This file contains \nnone of the inputs provided below – you will need to input these yourself. \n \nCOMPANY A \nCompany A pays a monthly figure of $17.3m. This is paid in 4 segments each month – 11% on day 5, \n21% on day 10, 41% on day 18 and the balance on day 23. Payments are made on the days specified \neven if it is a weekend. \n \nCOMPANY B \nCompany B has a daily charge of $0.35m that accrues daily. The accrued balance is paid monthly on the \nthird Thursday of the month. \nFor example, the payment for January 2018 has accruals from the third Friday in December 2017 until the \nthird Thursday in January 2018 (inclusive). \n \nCOMPANY C \nCompany has a daily charge of $0.18m per day. On weekdays the charge is paid on the same day, on the \nweekends it accrues and is paid on the Monday. \n \nCOMPANY D \nCompany D has a daily charge of $0.23m. This is paid once per month on the 15th. The monthly payment \nis based on the number of days in that calendar month. Payments are made on the day specified even if it \nis a weekend. \n \nCOMPANY E \nThe total monthly charge for Company E is calculated based on the number of Tuesdays in the month at a \nrate of $1.96m per Tuesday. This is paid evenly across all the weekdays of that month. \nRound 2 Section 1 - Case Study Information Pack \n\nCOMPANY F \nCompany F makes 3 payments per month, each of $5.34m. They are paid on the 7th, 14th and 20th of the \nmonth. However, if the payment date is a weekend, it is instead paid on the Friday before the weekend. \n \nCOMPANY G \nCompany G makes a single monthly payment of $9.23m. On even months (February, April etc) it is paid \non the first weekday of the month. On odd months (January, March etc), it is paid on the third weekday of \nthe month. \n \nCOMPANY H \nCompany H makes a payment of $1.79m every Wednesday. However, if the payment falls on the first 10 \ndays of the month it is instead paid 1 day earlier. If the payment falls on the last 10 days of the month, it is \ninstead paid one day later.\n \nFor Questions 1 – 9, 11, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 10 and 12, you are required to type in your answer.\n\nQuestion 3 What is the cash received in $m from Company C between 15 Jul 2018 and 24 Nov 2018 (inclusive)?

INSTRUCTIONS\nYou are preparing a daily cash flow revenue forecast for a company that has 8 customers (Company A – \nCompany H), all with very specific payment terms. No expense calculations are required. \nThe questions all relate to the 2018 calendar year, but you may need to model before/after this period to \naccurately calculate the cash forecast (calculations should include the relevant days in 2017 and 2019 \nwhere the payment methodology requires it).  \nDo not round your answers at any stage in the model. \nA weekday is defined as a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. A weekend is defined as \nSaturday and Sunday. There are no holidays to consider. \nYou have been provided with an excel workbook file with the ModelOff formatting to use. This file contains \nnone of the inputs provided below – you will need to input these yourself. \n \nCOMPANY A \nCompany A pays a monthly figure of $17.3m. This is paid in 4 segments each month – 11% on day 5, \n21% on day 10, 41% on day 18 and the balance on day 23. Payments are made on the days specified \neven if it is a weekend. \n \nCOMPANY B \nCompany B has a daily charge of $0.35m that accrues daily. The accrued balance is paid monthly on the \nthird Thursday of the month. \nFor example, the payment for January 2018 has accruals from the third Friday in December 2017 until the \nthird Thursday in January 2018 (inclusive). \n \nCOMPANY C \nCompany has a daily charge of $0.18m per day. On weekdays the charge is paid on the same day, on the \nweekends it accrues and is paid on the Monday. \n \nCOMPANY D \nCompany D has a daily charge of $0.23m. This is paid once per month on the 15th. The monthly payment \nis based on the number of days in that calendar month. Payments are made on the day specified even if it \nis a weekend. \n \nCOMPANY E \nThe total monthly charge for Company E is calculated based on the number of Tuesdays in the month at a \nrate of $1.96m per Tuesday. This is paid evenly across all the weekdays of that month. \nRound 2 Section 1 - Case Study Information Pack \n\nCOMPANY F \nCompany F makes 3 payments per month, each of $5.34m. They are paid on the 7th, 14th and 20th of the \nmonth. However, if the payment date is a weekend, it is instead paid on the Friday before the weekend. \n \nCOMPANY G \nCompany G makes a single monthly payment of $9.23m. On even months (February, April etc) it is paid \non the first weekday of the month. On odd months (January, March etc), it is paid on the third weekday of \nthe month. \n \nCOMPANY H \nCompany H makes a payment of $1.79m every Wednesday. However, if the payment falls on the first 10 \ndays of the month it is instead paid 1 day earlier. If the payment falls on the last 10 days of the month, it is \ninstead paid one day later.\n \nFor Questions 1 – 9, 11, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 10 and 12, you are required to type in your answer.\n\nQuestion 7 How many times was cash received from Company G on the third day of the month is 2018?

No expense calculations are required. \nThe questions all relate to the 2018 calendar year, but you may need to model before/after this period to \naccurately calculate the cash forecast (calculations should include the relevant days in 2017 and 2019 \nwhere the payment methodology requires it).  \nDo not round your answers at any stage in the model. \nA weekday is defined as a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. A weekend is defined as \nSaturday and Sunday. There are no holidays to consider. \nYou have been provided with an excel workbook file with the ModelOff formatting to use. This file contains \nnone of the inputs provided below – you will need to input these yourself. \n \nCOMPANY A \nCompany A pays a monthly figure of $17.3m. This is paid in 4 segments each month – 11% on day 5, \n21% on day 10, 41% on day 18 and the balance on day 23. Payments are made on the days specified \neven if it is a weekend. \n \nCOMPANY B \nCompany B has a daily charge of $0.35m that accrues daily. The accrued balance is paid monthly on the \nthird Thursday of the month. \nFor example, the payment for January 2018 has accruals from the third Friday in December 2017 until the \nthird Thursday in January 2018 (inclusive). \n \nCOMPANY C \nCompany has a daily charge of $0.18m per day. On weekdays the charge is paid on the same day, on the \nweekends it accrues and is paid on the Monday. \n \nCOMPANY D \nCompany D has a daily charge of $0.23m. This is paid once per month on the 15th. The monthly payment \nis based on the number of days in that calendar month. Payments are made on the day specified even if it \nis a weekend. \n \nCOMPANY E \nThe total monthly charge for Company E is calculated based on the number of Tuesdays in the month at a \nrate of $1.96m per Tuesday. This is paid evenly across all the weekdays of that month. \nRound 2 Section 1 - Case Study Information Pack \n\nCOMPANY F \nCompany F makes 3 payments per month, each of $5.34m. They are paid on the 7th, 14th and 20th of the \nmonth. However, if the payment date is a weekend, it is instead paid on the Friday before the weekend. \n \nCOMPANY G \nCompany G makes a single monthly payment of $9.23m. On even months (February, April etc) it is paid \non the first weekday of the month. On odd months (January, March etc), it is paid on the third weekday of \nthe month. \n \nCOMPANY H \nCompany H makes a payment of $1.79m every Wednesday. However, if the payment falls on the first 10 \ndays of the month it is instead paid 1 day earlier. If the payment falls on the last 10 days of the month, it is \ninstead paid one day later.\n \nFor Questions 1 – 9, 11, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 10 and 12, you are required to type in your answer.\n\nQuestion 11 For Company F, the payments are now received on the 6th, 13th and 19th of the month (and still get adjusted to before the weekend if they fall on the weekend).

No expense calculations are required. \nThe questions all relate to the 2018 calendar year, but you may need to model before/after this period to \naccurately calculate the cash forecast (calculations should include the relevant days in 2017 and 2019 \nwhere the payment methodology requires it).  \nDo not round your answers at any stage in the model. \nA weekday is defined as a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. A weekend is defined as \nSaturday and Sunday. There are no holidays to consider. \nYou have been provided with an excel workbook file with the ModelOff formatting to use. This file contains \nnone of the inputs provided below – you will need to input these yourself. \n \nCOMPANY A \nCompany A pays a monthly figure of $17.3m.

This is paid once per month on the 15th. The monthly payment \nis based on the number of days in that calendar month. Payments are made on the day specified even if it \nis a weekend. \n \nCOMPANY E \nThe total monthly charge for Company E is calculated based on the number of Tuesdays in the month at a \nrate of $1.96m per Tuesday. This is paid evenly across all the weekdays of that month. \nRound 2 Section 1 - Case Study Information Pack \n\nCOMPANY F \nCompany F makes 3 payments per month, each of $5.34m. They are paid on the 7th, 14th and 20th of the \nmonth. However, if the payment date is a weekend, it is instead paid on the Friday before the weekend. \n \nCOMPANY G \nCompany G makes a single monthly payment of $9.23m. On even months (February, April etc) it is paid \non the first weekday of the month. On odd months (January, March etc), it is paid on the third weekday of \nthe month. \n \nCOMPANY H \nCompany H makes a payment of $1.79m every Wednesday. However, if the payment falls on the first 10 \ndays of the month it is instead paid 1 day earlier.

They have asked you to model their two senior debt facilities, two reserve accounts and \nshareholder loan, and then test how the debts are repaid and reserves are funded under different profiles \nof cash generated from operations. \nYour model should be semi-annual with semi-annual periods ending in June and December. All debt \npayments and reserve account transfers occur at the end of a semi-annual period. The model should take \nas its starting point the debt and account balances on 31 December 2017, and should run through to 31 \nDecember 2035. \nQuestions 29 to 34 relate to the target payments and balances and can be answered based on the \ndetails given for the individual facilities and accounts. \nQuestions 35 to 39 relate to the actual payments made under five different profiles of available \ncash, and will require you to have implemented the priority of payments. The cash profiles you are \nrequired to test are increasingly restricted, such that under the first profile everything is fully \nfunded and target balances are met, and under the fifth profile an overdraft is drawn. \nPrepare your model and then use it to answer the given questions. When finished, please upload \nyour workbook (Question 40). \nSENIOR LOANS \nThere are two senior loans. \nSenior 1 \nThe loan balance on 31 December 2017 is $10,000,000.  \nThe loan should be repaid in equal principal repayment amounts with the final repayment occurring in the \nperiod ending 31 December 2023. \nThe interest rates applied to the loan are given in the table below, and interest should be paid as incurred. \nThe annual interest rates should be converted to semi-annual rates by multiplying by the number of days \nthe rate is applied for in the semi-annual period and dividing by 365.\n\n From               To                   Rate (per annum)\n1 January 2018     14 December 2019     4.35%\n15 December 2019   4 April 2021         5.5%\n5 April 2021       24 October 2023      5.8%\n25 October 2023    31 December 2023     6.2%\n\n \nSenior 2 \nThe starting balance for the senior 2 loan is $10,000,000. \nFrom June 2024 onwards principal repayments of $1,000,000 or the outstanding loan amount (whichever \nis smaller) should be made each payment date.\n \nThe interest rate for the Senior 2 loan is 6% per annum. This should be converted to a semi-annual rate \nby dividing by two. Until 31 December 2023 interest incurred should be added to the balance of the loan \n(interest should be incurred on capitalized interest in subsequent semi-annual periods). From 1 January \n2024 onwards interest should be paid as incurred. \nTARGET RESERVE ACCOUNT BALANCES \nThe target debt service reserve account balance is the total senior debt interest and repayments due in \nthe next semi-annual period.  Assume that this account is fully funded on 31 December 2017. \nThe target MMRA balance is 100% of the next twelve months’ major maintenance costs, 66% of the costs \nin the twelve months after that, and 33% of the costs in the twelve months after that. The profile of \nforecast major maintenance costs is given in the Assumptions tab of the provided workbook for this case \nstudy.  Assume that this account is fully funded on 31 December 2017. \nSHAREHOLDER LOAN \nOn 31 December 2017 the shareholder loan balance is $3,000,000. The interest rate for the loan is 9% \nper annum, and this is converted to a semi-annual rate by dividing by two. \nThe target shareholder loan balance is the balance that would result if the loan were an annuity that was \nfully repaid on 31 December 2030 (i.e. if the total interest and repayment amount in each semi-annual \nperiod was constant between June 2018 and December 2030). \nPRIORITY OF PAYMENTS \nIf the balances of the debt service reserve account (DSRA) and major maintenance reserve account \n(MMRA) at the start of the semi-annual period exceed the target balance for the semi-annual period any \nexcess should be added to the cash generated from operations. Available cash should then be used \naccording to the following rules: \n1. The senior interest payments and repayments should always be made. If insufficient cash is \ngenerated from operations to do this, the company does the following in this order until the senior \ndebt payments are made in full: \n• Withdraw money from the debt service reserve account\n• Withdraw money from the major maintenance reserve account\n• Draw an overdraft in the cash account (it is NOT possible to draw an overdraft in the reserve\naccounts). \nAny overdraft drawn should be carried forward from period to period until it is repaid from \navailable cash. Assume that no interest or other costs are incurred related to the overdraft. \nAny available cash left after the senior debt has been serviced should then be used in the following order: \n2. Repay any overdraft drawn in the cash account in previous periods \n3. Fund the MMRA up to the target balance \n4. Fund the DSRA up to the target balance \n5. Pay any interest due on the shareholder loan. Any interest for which there is not enough cash to \npay should be added to the loan balance. \n6. Pay off any outstanding shareholder loan which exceeds the target balance for that semi-annual \nperiod. \nAny cash that is remaining after the debts have been fully serviced and the reserve accounts are fully \nfunded is then paid to the shareholders as a dividend.  \n\nQuestion 29 What is the interest rate for the Senior 1 loan in the period ending 31 December 2019?

They have asked you to model their two senior debt facilities, two reserve accounts and \nshareholder loan, and then test how the debts are repaid and reserves are funded under different profiles \nof cash generated from operations. \nYour model should be semi-annual with semi-annual periods ending in June and December. All debt \npayments and reserve account transfers occur at the end of a semi-annual period. The model should take \nas its starting point the debt and account balances on 31 December 2017, and should run through to 31 \nDecember 2035. \nQuestions 29 to 34 relate to the target payments and balances and can be answered based on the \ndetails given for the individual facilities and accounts. \nQuestions 35 to 39 relate to the actual payments made under five different profiles of available \ncash, and will require you to have implemented the priority of payments. The cash profiles you are \nrequired to test are increasingly restricted, such that under the first profile everything is fully \nfunded and target balances are met, and under the fifth profile an overdraft is drawn. \nPrepare your model and then use it to answer the given questions. When finished, please upload \nyour workbook (Question 40). \nSENIOR LOANS \nThere are two senior loans. \nSenior 1 \nThe loan balance on 31 December 2017 is $10,000,000.  \nThe loan should be repaid in equal principal repayment amounts with the final repayment occurring in the \nperiod ending 31 December 2023. \nThe interest rates applied to the loan are given in the table below, and interest should be paid as incurred. \nThe annual interest rates should be converted to semi-annual rates by multiplying by the number of days \nthe rate is applied for in the semi-annual period and dividing by 365.\n\n From               To                   Rate (per annum)\n1 January 2018     14 December 2019     4.35%\n15 December 2019   4 April 2021         5.5%\n5 April 2021       24 October 2023      5.8%\n25 October 2023    31 December 2023     6.2%\n\n \nSenior 2 \nThe starting balance for the senior 2 loan is $10,000,000. \nFrom June 2024 onwards principal repayments of $1,000,000 or the outstanding loan amount (whichever \nis smaller) should be made each payment date.\n \nThe interest rate for the Senior 2 loan is 6% per annum. This should be converted to a semi-annual rate \nby dividing by two. Until 31 December 2023 interest incurred should be added to the balance of the loan \n(interest should be incurred on capitalized interest in subsequent semi-annual periods). From 1 January \n2024 onwards interest should be paid as incurred. \nTARGET RESERVE ACCOUNT BALANCES \nThe target debt service reserve account balance is the total senior debt interest and repayments due in \nthe next semi-annual period.  Assume that this account is fully funded on 31 December 2017. \nThe target MMRA balance is 100% of the next twelve months’ major maintenance costs, 66% of the costs \nin the twelve months after that, and 33% of the costs in the twelve months after that. The profile of \nforecast major maintenance costs is given in the Assumptions tab of the provided workbook for this case \nstudy.  Assume that this account is fully funded on 31 December 2017. \nSHAREHOLDER LOAN \nOn 31 December 2017 the shareholder loan balance is $3,000,000. The interest rate for the loan is 9% \nper annum, and this is converted to a semi-annual rate by dividing by two. \nThe target shareholder loan balance is the balance that would result if the loan were an annuity that was \nfully repaid on 31 December 2030 (i.e. if the total interest and repayment amount in each semi-annual \nperiod was constant between June 2018 and December 2030). \nPRIORITY OF PAYMENTS \nIf the balances of the debt service reserve account (DSRA) and major maintenance reserve account \n(MMRA) at the start of the semi-annual period exceed the target balance for the semi-annual period any \nexcess should be added to the cash generated from operations. Available cash should then be used \naccording to the following rules: \n1. The senior interest payments and repayments should always be made. If insufficient cash is \ngenerated from operations to do this, the company does the following in this order until the senior \ndebt payments are made in full: \n• Withdraw money from the debt service reserve account\n• Withdraw money from the major maintenance reserve account\n• Draw an overdraft in the cash account (it is NOT possible to draw an overdraft in the reserve\naccounts). \nAny overdraft drawn should be carried forward from period to period until it is repaid from \navailable cash. Assume that no interest or other costs are incurred related to the overdraft. \nAny available cash left after the senior debt has been serviced should then be used in the following order: \n2. Repay any overdraft drawn in the cash account in previous periods \n3. Fund the MMRA up to the target balance \n4. Fund the DSRA up to the target balance \n5. Pay any interest due on the shareholder loan. Any interest for which there is not enough cash to \npay should be added to the loan balance. \n6. Pay off any outstanding shareholder loan which exceeds the target balance for that semi-annual \nperiod. \nAny cash that is remaining after the debts have been fully serviced and the reserve accounts are fully \nfunded is then paid to the shareholders as a dividend.  \n\nQuestion 31 What is the final repayment amount for the Senior 2 loan?

All debt \npayments and reserve account transfers occur at the end of a semi-annual period.

The cash profiles you are \nrequired to test are increasingly restricted, such that under the first profile everything is fully \nfunded and target balances are met, and under the fifth profile an overdraft is drawn. \nPrepare your model and then use it to answer the given questions. When finished, please upload \nyour workbook (Question 40). \nSENIOR LOANS \nThere are two senior loans. \nSenior 1 \nThe loan balance on 31 December 2017 is $10,000,000.  \nThe loan should be repaid in equal principal repayment amounts with the final repayment occurring in the \nperiod ending 31 December 2023. \nThe interest rates applied to the loan are given in the table below, and interest should be paid as incurred. \nThe annual interest rates should be converted to semi-annual rates by multiplying by the number of days \nthe rate is applied for in the semi-annual period and dividing by 365.\n\n From               To                   Rate (per annum)\n1 January 2018     14 December 2019     4.35%\n15 December 2019   4 April 2021         5.5%\n5 April 2021       24 October 2023      5.8%\n25 October 2023    31 December 2023     6.2%\n\n \nSenior 2 \nThe starting balance for the senior 2 loan is $10,000,000. \nFrom June 2024 onwards principal repayments of $1,000,000 or the outstanding loan amount (whichever \nis smaller) should be made each payment date.\n \nThe interest rate for the Senior 2 loan is 6% per annum. This should be converted to a semi-annual rate \nby dividing by two. Until 31 December 2023 interest incurred should be added to the balance of the loan \n(interest should be incurred on capitalized interest in subsequent semi-annual periods). From 1 January \n2024 onwards interest should be paid as incurred. \nTARGET RESERVE ACCOUNT BALANCES \nThe target debt service reserve account balance is the total senior debt interest and repayments due in \nthe next semi-annual period.  Assume that this account is fully funded on 31 December 2017. \nThe target MMRA balance is 100% of the next twelve months’ major maintenance costs, 66% of the costs \nin the twelve months after that, and 33% of the costs in the twelve months after that. The profile of \nforecast major maintenance costs is given in the Assumptions tab of the provided workbook for this case \nstudy.  Assume that this account is fully funded on 31 December 2017. \nSHAREHOLDER LOAN \nOn 31 December 2017 the shareholder loan balance is $3,000,000. The interest rate for the loan is 9% \nper annum, and this is converted to a semi-annual rate by dividing by two. \nThe target shareholder loan balance is the balance that would result if the loan were an annuity that was \nfully repaid on 31 December 2030 (i.e. if the total interest and repayment amount in each semi-annual \nperiod was constant between June 2018 and December 2030). \nPRIORITY OF PAYMENTS \nIf the balances of the debt service reserve account (DSRA) and major maintenance reserve account \n(MMRA) at the start of the semi-annual period exceed the target balance for the semi-annual period any \nexcess should be added to the cash generated from operations. Available cash should then be used \naccording to the following rules: \n1. The senior interest payments and repayments should always be made. If insufficient cash is \ngenerated from operations to do this, the company does the following in this order until the senior \ndebt payments are made in full: \n• Withdraw money from the debt service reserve account\n• Withdraw money from the major maintenance reserve account\n• Draw an overdraft in the cash account (it is NOT possible to draw an overdraft in the reserve\naccounts). \nAny overdraft drawn should be carried forward from period to period until it is repaid from \navailable cash. Assume that no interest or other costs are incurred related to the overdraft. \nAny available cash left after the senior debt has been serviced should then be used in the following order: \n2. Repay any overdraft drawn in the cash account in previous periods \n3. Fund the MMRA up to the target balance \n4. Fund the DSRA up to the target balance \n5. Pay any interest due on the shareholder loan. Any interest for which there is not enough cash to \npay should be added to the loan balance. \n6. Pay off any outstanding shareholder loan which exceeds the target balance for that semi-annual \nperiod. \nAny cash that is remaining after the debts have been fully serviced and the reserve accounts are fully \nfunded is then paid to the shareholders as a dividend.  \n\nQuestion 33 What is the target MMRA balance on 31 December 2020?

They have asked you to model their two senior debt facilities, two reserve accounts and \nshareholder loan, and then test how the debts are repaid and reserves are funded under different profiles \nof cash generated from operations. \nYour model should be semi-annual with semi-annual periods ending in June and December. All debt \npayments and reserve account transfers occur at the end of a semi-annual period. The model should take \nas its starting point the debt and account balances on 31 December 2017, and should run through to 31 \nDecember 2035. \nQuestions 29 to 34 relate to the target payments and balances and can be answered based on the \ndetails given for the individual facilities and accounts. \nQuestions 35 to 39 relate to the actual payments made under five different profiles of available \ncash, and will require you to have implemented the priority of payments. The cash profiles you are \nrequired to test are increasingly restricted, such that under the first profile everything is fully \nfunded and target balances are met, and under the fifth profile an overdraft is drawn. \nPrepare your model and then use it to answer the given questions. When finished, please upload \nyour workbook (Question 40). \nSENIOR LOANS \nThere are two senior loans. \nSenior 1 \nThe loan balance on 31 December 2017 is $10,000,000.  \nThe loan should be repaid in equal principal repayment amounts with the final repayment occurring in the \nperiod ending 31 December 2023. \nThe interest rates applied to the loan are given in the table below, and interest should be paid as incurred. \nThe annual interest rates should be converted to semi-annual rates by multiplying by the number of days \nthe rate is applied for in the semi-annual period and dividing by 365.\n\n From               To                   Rate (per annum)\n1 January 2018     14 December 2019     4.35%\n15 December 2019   4 April 2021         5.5%\n5 April 2021       24 October 2023      5.8%\n25 October 2023    31 December 2023     6.2%\n\n \nSenior 2 \nThe starting balance for the senior 2 loan is $10,000,000. \nFrom June 2024 onwards principal repayments of $1,000,000 or the outstanding loan amount (whichever \nis smaller) should be made each payment date.\n \nThe interest rate for the Senior 2 loan is 6% per annum. This should be converted to a semi-annual rate \nby dividing by two. Until 31 December 2023 interest incurred should be added to the balance of the loan \n(interest should be incurred on capitalized interest in subsequent semi-annual periods). From 1 January \n2024 onwards interest should be paid as incurred. \nTARGET RESERVE ACCOUNT BALANCES \nThe target debt service reserve account balance is the total senior debt interest and repayments due in \nthe next semi-annual period.  Assume that this account is fully funded on 31 December 2017. \nThe target MMRA balance is 100% of the next twelve months’ major maintenance costs, 66% of the costs \nin the twelve months after that, and 33% of the costs in the twelve months after that. The profile of \nforecast major maintenance costs is given in the Assumptions tab of the provided workbook for this case \nstudy.  Assume that this account is fully funded on 31 December 2017. \nSHAREHOLDER LOAN \nOn 31 December 2017 the shareholder loan balance is $3,000,000. The interest rate for the loan is 9% \nper annum, and this is converted to a semi-annual rate by dividing by two. \nThe target shareholder loan balance is the balance that would result if the loan were an annuity that was \nfully repaid on 31 December 2030 (i.e. if the total interest and repayment amount in each semi-annual \nperiod was constant between June 2018 and December 2030). \nPRIORITY OF PAYMENTS \nIf the balances of the debt service reserve account (DSRA) and major maintenance reserve account \n(MMRA) at the start of the semi-annual period exceed the target balance for the semi-annual period any \nexcess should be added to the cash generated from operations. Available cash should then be used \naccording to the following rules: \n1. The senior interest payments and repayments should always be made. If insufficient cash is \ngenerated from operations to do this, the company does the following in this order until the senior \ndebt payments are made in full: \n• Withdraw money from the debt service reserve account\n• Withdraw money from the major maintenance reserve account\n• Draw an overdraft in the cash account (it is NOT possible to draw an overdraft in the reserve\naccounts). \nAny overdraft drawn should be carried forward from period to period until it is repaid from \navailable cash. Assume that no interest or other costs are incurred related to the overdraft. \nAny available cash left after the senior debt has been serviced should then be used in the following order: \n2. Repay any overdraft drawn in the cash account in previous periods \n3. Fund the MMRA up to the target balance \n4. Fund the DSRA up to the target balance \n5. Pay any interest due on the shareholder loan. Any interest for which there is not enough cash to \npay should be added to the loan balance. \n6. Pay off any outstanding shareholder loan which exceeds the target balance for that semi-annual \nperiod. \nAny cash that is remaining after the debts have been fully serviced and the reserve accounts are fully \nfunded is then paid to the shareholders as a dividend.  \n\nQuestion 35 Using Profile 1 of cash available from operations, what are the total dividends paid to the shareholders?

They have asked you to model their two senior debt facilities, two reserve accounts and \nshareholder loan, and then test how the debts are repaid and reserves are funded under different profiles \nof cash generated from operations. \nYour model should be semi-annual with semi-annual periods ending in June and December. All debt \npayments and reserve account transfers occur at the end of a semi-annual period. The model should take \nas its starting point the debt and account balances on 31 December 2017, and should run through to 31 \nDecember 2035. \nQuestions 29 to 34 relate to the target payments and balances and can be answered based on the \ndetails given for the individual facilities and accounts. \nQuestions 35 to 39 relate to the actual payments made under five different profiles of available \ncash, and will require you to have implemented the priority of payments. The cash profiles you are \nrequired to test are increasingly restricted, such that under the first profile everything is fully \nfunded and target balances are met, and under the fifth profile an overdraft is drawn. \nPrepare your model and then use it to answer the given questions. When finished, please upload \nyour workbook (Question 40). \nSENIOR LOANS \nThere are two senior loans. \nSenior 1 \nThe loan balance on 31 December 2017 is $10,000,000.  \nThe loan should be repaid in equal principal repayment amounts with the final repayment occurring in the \nperiod ending 31 December 2023. \nThe interest rates applied to the loan are given in the table below, and interest should be paid as incurred. \nThe annual interest rates should be converted to semi-annual rates by multiplying by the number of days \nthe rate is applied for in the semi-annual period and dividing by 365.\n\n From               To                   Rate (per annum)\n1 January 2018     14 December 2019     4.35%\n15 December 2019   4 April 2021         5.5%\n5 April 2021       24 October 2023      5.8%\n25 October 2023    31 December 2023     6.2%\n\n \nSenior 2 \nThe starting balance for the senior 2 loan is $10,000,000. \nFrom June 2024 onwards principal repayments of $1,000,000 or the outstanding loan amount (whichever \nis smaller) should be made each payment date.\n \nThe interest rate for the Senior 2 loan is 6% per annum. This should be converted to a semi-annual rate \nby dividing by two. Until 31 December 2023 interest incurred should be added to the balance of the loan \n(interest should be incurred on capitalized interest in subsequent semi-annual periods). From 1 January \n2024 onwards interest should be paid as incurred. \nTARGET RESERVE ACCOUNT BALANCES \nThe target debt service reserve account balance is the total senior debt interest and repayments due in \nthe next semi-annual period.  Assume that this account is fully funded on 31 December 2017. \nThe target MMRA balance is 100% of the next twelve months’ major maintenance costs, 66% of the costs \nin the twelve months after that, and 33% of the costs in the twelve months after that. The profile of \nforecast major maintenance costs is given in the Assumptions tab of the provided workbook for this case \nstudy.  Assume that this account is fully funded on 31 December 2017. \nSHAREHOLDER LOAN \nOn 31 December 2017 the shareholder loan balance is $3,000,000. The interest rate for the loan is 9% \nper annum, and this is converted to a semi-annual rate by dividing by two. \nThe target shareholder loan balance is the balance that would result if the loan were an annuity that was \nfully repaid on 31 December 2030 (i.e. if the total interest and repayment amount in each semi-annual \nperiod was constant between June 2018 and December 2030). \nPRIORITY OF PAYMENTS \nIf the balances of the debt service reserve account (DSRA) and major maintenance reserve account \n(MMRA) at the start of the semi-annual period exceed the target balance for the semi-annual period any \nexcess should be added to the cash generated from operations. Available cash should then be used \naccording to the following rules: \n1. The senior interest payments and repayments should always be made. If insufficient cash is \ngenerated from operations to do this, the company does the following in this order until the senior \ndebt payments are made in full: \n• Withdraw money from the debt service reserve account\n• Withdraw money from the major maintenance reserve account\n• Draw an overdraft in the cash account (it is NOT possible to draw an overdraft in the reserve\naccounts). \nAny overdraft drawn should be carried forward from period to period until it is repaid from \navailable cash. Assume that no interest or other costs are incurred related to the overdraft. \nAny available cash left after the senior debt has been serviced should then be used in the following order: \n2. Repay any overdraft drawn in the cash account in previous periods \n3. Fund the MMRA up to the target balance \n4. Fund the DSRA up to the target balance \n5. Pay any interest due on the shareholder loan. Any interest for which there is not enough cash to \npay should be added to the loan balance. \n6. Pay off any outstanding shareholder loan which exceeds the target balance for that semi-annual \nperiod. \nAny cash that is remaining after the debts have been fully serviced and the reserve accounts are fully \nfunded is then paid to the shareholders as a dividend.  \n\nQuestion 37 Using Profile 3 of cash available from operations, in how many semi-annual periods is the DSRA underfunded?

They have asked you to model their two senior debt facilities, two reserve accounts and \nshareholder loan, and then test how the debts are repaid and reserves are funded under different profiles \nof cash generated from operations. \nYour model should be semi-annual with semi-annual periods ending in June and December. All debt \npayments and reserve account transfers occur at the end of a semi-annual period. The model should take \nas its starting point the debt and account balances on 31 December 2017, and should run through to 31 \nDecember 2035. \nQuestions 29 to 34 relate to the target payments and balances and can be answered based on the \ndetails given for the individual facilities and accounts. \nQuestions 35 to 39 relate to the actual payments made under five different profiles of available \ncash, and will require you to have implemented the priority of payments. The cash profiles you are \nrequired to test are increasingly restricted, such that under the first profile everything is fully \nfunded and target balances are met, and under the fifth profile an overdraft is drawn. \nPrepare your model and then use it to answer the given questions. When finished, please upload \nyour workbook (Question 40). \nSENIOR LOANS \nThere are two senior loans. \nSenior 1 \nThe loan balance on 31 December 2017 is $10,000,000.  \nThe loan should be repaid in equal principal repayment amounts with the final repayment occurring in the \nperiod ending 31 December 2023. \nThe interest rates applied to the loan are given in the table below, and interest should be paid as incurred. \nThe annual interest rates should be converted to semi-annual rates by multiplying by the number of days \nthe rate is applied for in the semi-annual period and dividing by 365.\n\n From               To                   Rate (per annum)\n1 January 2018     14 December 2019     4.35%\n15 December 2019   4 April 2021         5.5%\n5 April 2021       24 October 2023      5.8%\n25 October 2023    31 December 2023     6.2%\n\n \nSenior 2 \nThe starting balance for the senior 2 loan is $10,000,000. \nFrom June 2024 onwards principal repayments of $1,000,000 or the outstanding loan amount (whichever \nis smaller) should be made each payment date.\n \nThe interest rate for the Senior 2 loan is 6% per annum. This should be converted to a semi-annual rate \nby dividing by two. Until 31 December 2023 interest incurred should be added to the balance of the loan \n(interest should be incurred on capitalized interest in subsequent semi-annual periods). From 1 January \n2024 onwards interest should be paid as incurred. \nTARGET RESERVE ACCOUNT BALANCES \nThe target debt service reserve account balance is the total senior debt interest and repayments due in \nthe next semi-annual period.  Assume that this account is fully funded on 31 December 2017. \nThe target MMRA balance is 100% of the next twelve months’ major maintenance costs, 66% of the costs \nin the twelve months after that, and 33% of the costs in the twelve months after that. The profile of \nforecast major maintenance costs is given in the Assumptions tab of the provided workbook for this case \nstudy.  Assume that this account is fully funded on 31 December 2017. \nSHAREHOLDER LOAN \nOn 31 December 2017 the shareholder loan balance is $3,000,000. The interest rate for the loan is 9% \nper annum, and this is converted to a semi-annual rate by dividing by two. \nThe target shareholder loan balance is the balance that would result if the loan were an annuity that was \nfully repaid on 31 December 2030 (i.e. if the total interest and repayment amount in each semi-annual \nperiod was constant between June 2018 and December 2030). \nPRIORITY OF PAYMENTS \nIf the balances of the debt service reserve account (DSRA) and major maintenance reserve account \n(MMRA) at the start of the semi-annual period exceed the target balance for the semi-annual period any \nexcess should be added to the cash generated from operations. Available cash should then be used \naccording to the following rules: \n1. The senior interest payments and repayments should always be made. If insufficient cash is \ngenerated from operations to do this, the company does the following in this order until the senior \ndebt payments are made in full: \n• Withdraw money from the debt service reserve account\n• Withdraw money from the major maintenance reserve account\n• Draw an overdraft in the cash account (it is NOT possible to draw an overdraft in the reserve\naccounts). \nAny overdraft drawn should be carried forward from period to period until it is repaid from \navailable cash. Assume that no interest or other costs are incurred related to the overdraft. \nAny available cash left after the senior debt has been serviced should then be used in the following order: \n2. Repay any overdraft drawn in the cash account in previous periods \n3. Fund the MMRA up to the target balance \n4. Fund the DSRA up to the target balance \n5. Pay any interest due on the shareholder loan. Any interest for which there is not enough cash to \npay should be added to the loan balance. \n6. Pay off any outstanding shareholder loan which exceeds the target balance for that semi-annual \nperiod. \nAny cash that is remaining after the debts have been fully serviced and the reserve accounts are fully \nfunded is then paid to the shareholders as a dividend.  \n\nQuestion 39 Using Profile 5 of cash available from operations, what is the maximum overdraft balance drawn at any point in time?

You have been \nasked to model each of the available investments to assist in choosing a portfolio (up to a maximum \npurchase price of $1,700,000) that maximises the value to the company, as measured by an increase in \nnet present value. The company’s cost of capital is 8%. \n \nAVAILABLE INVESTMENTS \nFull details of the investments may be found on the table on the subsequent page \n• The model should be monthly. For NPV purposes assume that all payments occur at the end of\nthe month and use the XNPV function. \n• The purchase price for each property should be paid on 31 December 2017.\n• The company holds the property for a number of years (the investment length).\n• During the investment length, the company receives rental revenue and pays operating costs.\n• Where amounts are indexed the base date is 1 January 2018 and the index should step annually\n(i.e. a full year of indexation should first be applied on 1 January 2019). Do NOT round inflated \nprices to whole cents in interim calculations. \n• At the end of the investment length, the company will sell the property for the terminal value.

You have been \nasked to model each of the available investments to assist in choosing a portfolio (up to a maximum \npurchase price of $1,700,000) that maximises the value to the company, as measured by an increase in \nnet present value. The company’s cost of capital is 8%. \n \nAVAILABLE INVESTMENTS \nFull details of the investments may be found on the table on the subsequent page \n• The model should be monthly. For NPV purposes assume that all payments occur at the end of\nthe month and use the XNPV function. \n• The purchase price for each property should be paid on 31 December 2017.\n• The company holds the property for a number of years (the investment length).\n• During the investment length, the company receives rental revenue and pays operating costs.\n• Where amounts are indexed the base date is 1 January 2018 and the index should step annually\n(i.e. a full year of indexation should first be applied on 1 January 2019). Do NOT round inflated \nprices to whole cents in interim calculations. \n• At the end of the investment length, the company will sell the property for the terminal value.

You have been \nasked to model each of the available investments to assist in choosing a portfolio (up to a maximum \npurchase price of $1,700,000) that maximises the value to the company, as measured by an increase in \nnet present value. The company’s cost of capital is 8%. \n \nAVAILABLE INVESTMENTS \nFull details of the investments may be found on the table on the subsequent page \n• The model should be monthly. For NPV purposes assume that all payments occur at the end of\nthe month and use the XNPV function. \n• The purchase price for each property should be paid on 31 December 2017.\n• The company holds the property for a number of years (the investment length).\n• During the investment length, the company receives rental revenue and pays operating costs.\n• Where amounts are indexed the base date is 1 January 2018 and the index should step annually\n(i.e. a full year of indexation should first be applied on 1 January 2019). Do NOT round inflated \nprices to whole cents in interim calculations. \n• At the end of the investment length, the company will sell the property for the terminal value.

You have been \nasked to model each of the available investments to assist in choosing a portfolio (up to a maximum \npurchase price of $1,700,000) that maximises the value to the company, as measured by an increase in \nnet present value. The company’s cost of capital is 8%. \n \nAVAILABLE INVESTMENTS \nFull details of the investments may be found on the table on the subsequent page \n• The model should be monthly. For NPV purposes assume that all payments occur at the end of\nthe month and use the XNPV function. \n• The purchase price for each property should be paid on 31 December 2017.\n• The company holds the property for a number of years (the investment length).\n• During the investment length, the company receives rental revenue and pays operating costs.\n• Where amounts are indexed the base date is 1 January 2018 and the index should step annually\n(i.e. a full year of indexation should first be applied on 1 January 2019). Do NOT round inflated \nprices to whole cents in interim calculations. \n• At the end of the investment length, the company will sell the property for the terminal value.

You have been \nasked to model each of the available investments to assist in choosing a portfolio (up to a maximum \npurchase price of $1,700,000) that maximises the value to the company, as measured by an increase in \nnet present value. The company’s cost of capital is 8%. \n \nAVAILABLE INVESTMENTS \nFull details of the investments may be found on the table on the subsequent page \n• The model should be monthly. For NPV purposes assume that all payments occur at the end of\nthe month and use the XNPV function. \n• The purchase price for each property should be paid on 31 December 2017.\n• The company holds the property for a number of years (the investment length).\n• During the investment length, the company receives rental revenue and pays operating costs.\n• Where amounts are indexed the base date is 1 January 2018 and the index should step annually\n(i.e. a full year of indexation should first be applied on 1 January 2019). Do NOT round inflated \nprices to whole cents in interim calculations. \n• At the end of the investment length, the company will sell the property for the terminal value.

You have been \nasked to model each of the available investments to assist in choosing a portfolio (up to a maximum \npurchase price of $1,700,000) that maximises the value to the company, as measured by an increase in \nnet present value. The company’s cost of capital is 8%. \n \nAVAILABLE INVESTMENTS \nFull details of the investments may be found on the table on the subsequent page \n• The model should be monthly. For NPV purposes assume that all payments occur at the end of\nthe month and use the XNPV function. \n• The purchase price for each property should be paid on 31 December 2017.\n• The company holds the property for a number of years (the investment length).\n• During the investment length, the company receives rental revenue and pays operating costs.\n• Where amounts are indexed the base date is 1 January 2018 and the index should step annually\n(i.e. a full year of indexation should first be applied on 1 January 2019). Do NOT round inflated \nprices to whole cents in interim calculations. \n• At the end of the investment length, the company will sell the property for the terminal value.

You have been \nasked to model each of the available investments to assist in choosing a portfolio (up to a maximum \npurchase price of $1,700,000) that maximises the value to the company, as measured by an increase in \nnet present value. The company’s cost of capital is 8%. \n \nAVAILABLE INVESTMENTS \nFull details of the investments may be found on the table on the subsequent page \n• The model should be monthly. For NPV purposes assume that all payments occur at the end of\nthe month and use the XNPV function. \n• The purchase price for each property should be paid on 31 December 2017.\n• The company holds the property for a number of years (the investment length).\n• During the investment length, the company receives rental revenue and pays operating costs.\n• Where amounts are indexed the base date is 1 January 2018 and the index should step annually\n(i.e. a full year of indexation should first be applied on 1 January 2019). Do NOT round inflated \nprices to whole cents in interim calculations. \n• At the end of the investment length, the company will sell the property for the terminal value.

You have been \nasked to model each of the available investments to assist in choosing a portfolio (up to a maximum \npurchase price of $1,700,000) that maximises the value to the company, as measured by an increase in \nnet present value. The company’s cost of capital is 8%. \n \nAVAILABLE INVESTMENTS \nFull details of the investments may be found on the table on the subsequent page \n• The model should be monthly. For NPV purposes assume that all payments occur at the end of\nthe month and use the XNPV function. \n• The purchase price for each property should be paid on 31 December 2017.\n• The company holds the property for a number of years (the investment length).\n• During the investment length, the company receives rental revenue and pays operating costs.\n• Where amounts are indexed the base date is 1 January 2018 and the index should step annually\n(i.e. a full year of indexation should first be applied on 1 January 2019). Do NOT round inflated \nprices to whole cents in interim calculations. \n• At the end of the investment length, the company will sell the property for the terminal value.

You have been \nasked to model each of the available investments to assist in choosing a portfolio (up to a maximum \npurchase price of $1,700,000) that maximises the value to the company, as measured by an increase in \nnet present value. The company’s cost of capital is 8%. \n \nAVAILABLE INVESTMENTS \nFull details of the investments may be found on the table on the subsequent page \n• The model should be monthly. For NPV purposes assume that all payments occur at the end of\nthe month and use the XNPV function. \n• The purchase price for each property should be paid on 31 December 2017.\n• The company holds the property for a number of years (the investment length).\n• During the investment length, the company receives rental revenue and pays operating costs.\n• Where amounts are indexed the base date is 1 January 2018 and the index should step annually\n(i.e. a full year of indexation should first be applied on 1 January 2019). Do NOT round inflated \nprices to whole cents in interim calculations. \n• At the end of the investment length, the company will sell the property for the terminal value.

You have been \nasked to model each of the available investments to assist in choosing a portfolio (up to a maximum \npurchase price of $1,700,000) that maximises the value to the company, as measured by an increase in \nnet present value. The company’s cost of capital is 8%. \n \nAVAILABLE INVESTMENTS \nFull details of the investments may be found on the table on the subsequent page \n• The model should be monthly. For NPV purposes assume that all payments occur at the end of\nthe month and use the XNPV function. \n• The purchase price for each property should be paid on 31 December 2017.\n• The company holds the property for a number of years (the investment length).\n• During the investment length, the company receives rental revenue and pays operating costs.\n• Where amounts are indexed the base date is 1 January 2018 and the index should step annually\n(i.e. a full year of indexation should first be applied on 1 January 2019). Do NOT round inflated \nprices to whole cents in interim calculations. \n• At the end of the investment length, the company will sell the property for the terminal value.

You have been \nasked to model each of the available investments to assist in choosing a portfolio (up to a maximum \npurchase price of $1,700,000) that maximises the value to the company, as measured by an increase in \nnet present value. The company’s cost of capital is 8%. \n \nAVAILABLE INVESTMENTS \nFull details of the investments may be found on the table on the subsequent page \n• The model should be monthly. For NPV purposes assume that all payments occur at the end of\nthe month and use the XNPV function. \n• The purchase price for each property should be paid on 31 December 2017.\n• The company holds the property for a number of years (the investment length).\n• During the investment length, the company receives rental revenue and pays operating costs.\n• Where amounts are indexed the base date is 1 January 2018 and the index should step annually\n(i.e. a full year of indexation should first be applied on 1 January 2019). Do NOT round inflated \nprices to whole cents in interim calculations. \n• At the end of the investment length, the company will sell the property for the terminal value.

You have been \nasked to model each of the available investments to assist in choosing a portfolio (up to a maximum \npurchase price of $1,700,000) that maximises the value to the company, as measured by an increase in \nnet present value. The company’s cost of capital is 8%. \n \nAVAILABLE INVESTMENTS \nFull details of the investments may be found on the table on the subsequent page \n• The model should be monthly. For NPV purposes assume that all payments occur at the end of\nthe month and use the XNPV function. \n• The purchase price for each property should be paid on 31 December 2017.\n• The company holds the property for a number of years (the investment length).\n• During the investment length, the company receives rental revenue and pays operating costs.\n• Where amounts are indexed the base date is 1 January 2018 and the index should step annually\n(i.e. a full year of indexation should first be applied on 1 January 2019). Do NOT round inflated \nprices to whole cents in interim calculations. \n• At the end of the investment length, the company will sell the property for the terminal value.

Each of the 4 people will create a \nspecial savings account and invest money at regular intervals, with the aim of being able to retire from \nwork once their savings account reaches a balance they are happy with.  The accounts will also earn an \ninvestment return.  Using the information and assumptions provided, you will need to calculate the \nforecast balances of the accounts at several points in the future as well as perform other analysis as \nasked. \nYour model can be either quarterly or annually as you deem appropriate.  It will need to cover a date \nrange starting at 31 December 2016 and run for 45 years. \nThe key model assumptions (discussed over page) have been provided to you in the Excel file titled \n‘MO16 Round 2 - Sec 2 - Fund the Future.xlsx’.  In some cases, the assumptions are in the Excel file as \ntext within sentences rather than pure numeric cells.\n \nASSUMPTIONS AND DEFINITIONS \nThe key assumptions for each person are provided in the supporting Excel file and in the table below.

Each of the 4 people will create a \nspecial savings account and invest money at regular intervals, with the aim of being able to retire from \nwork once their savings account reaches a balance they are happy with.  The accounts will also earn an \ninvestment return.  Using the information and assumptions provided, you will need to calculate the \nforecast balances of the accounts at several points in the future as well as perform other analysis as \nasked. \nYour model can be either quarterly or annually as you deem appropriate.  It will need to cover a date \nrange starting at 31 December 2016 and run for 45 years. \nThe key model assumptions (discussed over page) have been provided to you in the Excel file titled \n‘MO16 Round 2 - Sec 2 - Fund the Future.xlsx’.

Each of the 4 people will create a \nspecial savings account and invest money at regular intervals, with the aim of being able to retire from \nwork once their savings account reaches a balance they are happy with.  The accounts will also earn an \ninvestment return.  Using the information and assumptions provided, you will need to calculate the \nforecast balances of the accounts at several points in the future as well as perform other analysis as \nasked. \nYour model can be either quarterly or annually as you deem appropriate.  It will need to cover a date \nrange starting at 31 December 2016 and run for 45 years. \nThe key model assumptions (discussed over page) have been provided to you in the Excel file titled \n‘MO16 Round 2 - Sec 2 - Fund the Future.xlsx’.

Each of the 4 people will create a \nspecial savings account and invest money at regular intervals, with the aim of being able to retire from \nwork once their savings account reaches a balance they are happy with.  The accounts will also earn an \ninvestment return.  Using the information and assumptions provided, you will need to calculate the \nforecast balances of the accounts at several points in the future as well as perform other analysis as \nasked. \nYour model can be either quarterly or annually as you deem appropriate.  It will need to cover a date \nrange starting at 31 December 2016 and run for 45 years. \nThe key model assumptions (discussed over page) have been provided to you in the Excel file titled \n‘MO16 Round 2 - Sec 2 - Fund the Future.xlsx’.

P4L are investigating the \nconstruction of a new plant to produce vehicle parts. P4L operate in a country where there are four \ndifferent methods possible for tax depreciation. P4L can choose to depreciate under any of these four \nmethods. Once selected, which method is chosen can not be changed and must be used for all asset \nclasses. \nYou will need to develop a model to forecast the depreciation and net book value of P4L’s assets under \neach method. The model will be annual and cover 20 years from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2036. \nThe key model inputs (discussed below) have been provided to you in the Excel file titled \n‘MO16 Round 2 - Sec 4 - Maximize the Benefit.xlsx’. \nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE \nP4L will own assets in five different classes (A, B, C, D, E). The new plant will have capital expenditure \nacross each of these five asset classes. There is no existing asset balance for any asset class. \nThe capital expenditure profile for each asset class is provided in the supporting Excel file. This capital \nexpenditure is real as at 1 January 2017. These values should be inflated by 2% per annum on 1 January \nof each year from 1 January 2018 onwards. \nAssume all capital expenditure occurs at the start of the year. There is no salvage value or residual value \nfor any asset class. \nDEPRECIATION ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS \nThe four depreciations methods possible are: \n1.

P4L are investigating the \nconstruction of a new plant to produce vehicle parts. P4L operate in a country where there are four \ndifferent methods possible for tax depreciation. P4L can choose to depreciate under any of these four \nmethods. Once selected, which method is chosen can not be changed and must be used for all asset \nclasses. \nYou will need to develop a model to forecast the depreciation and net book value of P4L’s assets under \neach method. The model will be annual and cover 20 years from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2036. \nThe key model inputs (discussed below) have been provided to you in the Excel file titled \n‘MO16 Round 2 - Sec 4 - Maximize the Benefit.xlsx’. \nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE \nP4L will own assets in five different classes (A, B, C, D, E). The new plant will have capital expenditure \nacross each of these five asset classes. There is no existing asset balance for any asset class. \nThe capital expenditure profile for each asset class is provided in the supporting Excel file. This capital \nexpenditure is real as at 1 January 2017. These values should be inflated by 2% per annum on 1 January \nof each year from 1 January 2018 onwards. \nAssume all capital expenditure occurs at the start of the year. There is no salvage value or residual value \nfor any asset class. \nDEPRECIATION ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS \nThe four depreciations methods possible are: \n1. Declining balance (also known as diminishing value). \n2. Straight line \n3. Units of production \n4. Sum of the years \nThe key assumptions for each method by asset class are provided in the supporting Excel file and in the \ntable below: \n \nMethod                  Declining balance                 Straight line                        Units of production      Sum of the years\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnit                    Annual %                           Useful life, years                  See Excel file           Useful life, years\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClass A                 40%                                12 years                            See Excel file           12 years\nClass B                 5%                                 9 years                             See Excel file           9 years\nClass C                 15%                                7 years                             See Excel file           7 years\nClass D                 20%                                15 years                            See Excel file           15 years\nClass E                 15%                                24 years                            See Excel file           24 years\n\n \nDEPRECIATION METHOD EXAMPLES \nThe example used for this section will be for an asset purchased at the start of 2017 for $100: \n1) Declining balance \nThe asset is depreciated based on a % of the remaining asset balance.  \nExample – using a declining balance rate of 60% per annum \n\n\n \n2) Straight line \nThe asset is depreciated in an equal amount over each year of its useful life. \nExample – using a useful life of 3 years\n\nMethod                 2017         2018         2019         2020          Notes\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpening balance         -          40.00         16.00         6.40     The depreciation calculation\nAdditions             100.00         -             -             -      continues indefinitely.\nDepreciation          (60.00)      (24.00)       (9.60)       (3.84)\nClosing balance        40.00        16.00         6.40         2.56\n\n \n3) Units of production \nThe asset is depreciated in accordance with the % of its total lifetime units it produces each year. \nExample – using a depreciation profile of 70% in year 1, 20% in year 2 and 10% in year 3 \n\nMethod                 2017         2018         2019         2020          Notes\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpening balance         -          30.00         10.00          -     The depreciation profile of 70%,\nAdditions             100.00         -             -            -     20% and 10% is applied to the\nDepreciation          (70.00)      (20.00)       (10.00)         -    initial cost to calculate the\nClosing balance        30.00        10.00          -            -     annual depreciation.\n\n4) Sum of the years \nThe asset is depreciated in proportion to the remaining years of the asset’s life.

P4L are investigating the \nconstruction of a new plant to produce vehicle parts. P4L operate in a country where there are four \ndifferent methods possible for tax depreciation. P4L can choose to depreciate under any of these four \nmethods. Once selected, which method is chosen can not be changed and must be used for all asset \nclasses. \nYou will need to develop a model to forecast the depreciation and net book value of P4L’s assets under \neach method. The model will be annual and cover 20 years from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2036. \nThe key model inputs (discussed below) have been provided to you in the Excel file titled \n‘MO16 Round 2 - Sec 4 - Maximize the Benefit.xlsx’. \nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE \nP4L will own assets in five different classes (A, B, C, D, E). The new plant will have capital expenditure \nacross each of these five asset classes. There is no existing asset balance for any asset class. \nThe capital expenditure profile for each asset class is provided in the supporting Excel file. This capital \nexpenditure is real as at 1 January 2017. These values should be inflated by 2% per annum on 1 January \nof each year from 1 January 2018 onwards. \nAssume all capital expenditure occurs at the start of the year. There is no salvage value or residual value \nfor any asset class. \nDEPRECIATION ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS \nThe four depreciations methods possible are: \n1. Declining balance (also known as diminishing value). \n2. Straight line \n3. Units of production \n4. Sum of the years \nThe key assumptions for each method by asset class are provided in the supporting Excel file and in the \ntable below: \n \nMethod                  Declining balance                 Straight line                        Units of production      Sum of the years\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnit                    Annual %                           Useful life, years                  See Excel file           Useful life, years\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClass A                 40%                                12 years                            See Excel file           12 years\nClass B                 5%                                 9 years                             See Excel file           9 years\nClass C                 15%                                7 years                             See Excel file           7 years\nClass D                 20%                                15 years                            See Excel file           15 years\nClass E                 15%                                24 years                            See Excel file           24 years\n\n \nDEPRECIATION METHOD EXAMPLES \nThe example used for this section will be for an asset purchased at the start of 2017 for $100: \n1) Declining balance \nThe asset is depreciated based on a % of the remaining asset balance.  \nExample – using a declining balance rate of 60% per annum \n\n\n \n2) Straight line \nThe asset is depreciated in an equal amount over each year of its useful life. \nExample – using a useful life of 3 years\n\nMethod                 2017         2018         2019         2020          Notes\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpening balance         -          40.00         16.00         6.40     The depreciation calculation\nAdditions             100.00         -             -             -      continues indefinitely.\nDepreciation          (60.00)      (24.00)       (9.60)       (3.84)\nClosing balance        40.00        16.00         6.40         2.56\n\n \n3) Units of production \nThe asset is depreciated in accordance with the % of its total lifetime units it produces each year. \nExample – using a depreciation profile of 70% in year 1, 20% in year 2 and 10% in year 3 \n\nMethod                 2017         2018         2019         2020          Notes\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpening balance         -          30.00         10.00          -     The depreciation profile of 70%,\nAdditions             100.00         -             -            -     20% and 10% is applied to the\nDepreciation          (70.00)      (20.00)       (10.00)         -    initial cost to calculate the\nClosing balance        30.00        10.00          -            -     annual depreciation.\n\n4) Sum of the years \nThe asset is depreciated in proportion to the remaining years of the asset’s life.

P4L are investigating the \nconstruction of a new plant to produce vehicle parts. P4L operate in a country where there are four \ndifferent methods possible for tax depreciation. P4L can choose to depreciate under any of these four \nmethods. Once selected, which method is chosen can not be changed and must be used for all asset \nclasses. \nYou will need to develop a model to forecast the depreciation and net book value of P4L’s assets under \neach method. The model will be annual and cover 20 years from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2036. \nThe key model inputs (discussed below) have been provided to you in the Excel file titled \n‘MO16 Round 2 - Sec 4 - Maximize the Benefit.xlsx’. \nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE \nP4L will own assets in five different classes (A, B, C, D, E). The new plant will have capital expenditure \nacross each of these five asset classes. There is no existing asset balance for any asset class. \nThe capital expenditure profile for each asset class is provided in the supporting Excel file. This capital \nexpenditure is real as at 1 January 2017. These values should be inflated by 2% per annum on 1 January \nof each year from 1 January 2018 onwards. \nAssume all capital expenditure occurs at the start of the year. There is no salvage value or residual value \nfor any asset class. \nDEPRECIATION ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS \nThe four depreciations methods possible are: \n1. Declining balance (also known as diminishing value). \n2. Straight line \n3. Units of production \n4. Sum of the years \nThe key assumptions for each method by asset class are provided in the supporting Excel file and in the \ntable below: \n \nMethod                  Declining balance                 Straight line                        Units of production      Sum of the years\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnit                    Annual %                           Useful life, years                  See Excel file           Useful life, years\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClass A                 40%                                12 years                            See Excel file           12 years\nClass B                 5%                                 9 years                             See Excel file           9 years\nClass C                 15%                                7 years                             See Excel file           7 years\nClass D                 20%                                15 years                            See Excel file           15 years\nClass E                 15%                                24 years                            See Excel file           24 years\n\n \nDEPRECIATION METHOD EXAMPLES \nThe example used for this section will be for an asset purchased at the start of 2017 for $100: \n1) Declining balance \nThe asset is depreciated based on a % of the remaining asset balance.  \nExample – using a declining balance rate of 60% per annum \n\n\n \n2) Straight line \nThe asset is depreciated in an equal amount over each year of its useful life. \nExample – using a useful life of 3 years\n\nMethod                 2017         2018         2019         2020          Notes\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpening balance         -          40.00         16.00         6.40     The depreciation calculation\nAdditions             100.00         -             -             -      continues indefinitely.\nDepreciation          (60.00)      (24.00)       (9.60)       (3.84)\nClosing balance        40.00        16.00         6.40         2.56\n\n \n3) Units of production \nThe asset is depreciated in accordance with the % of its total lifetime units it produces each year. \nExample – using a depreciation profile of 70% in year 1, 20% in year 2 and 10% in year 3 \n\nMethod                 2017         2018         2019         2020          Notes\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpening balance         -          30.00         10.00          -     The depreciation profile of 70%,\nAdditions             100.00         -             -            -     20% and 10% is applied to the\nDepreciation          (70.00)      (20.00)       (10.00)         -    initial cost to calculate the\nClosing balance        30.00        10.00          -            -     annual depreciation.\n\n4) Sum of the years \nThe asset is depreciated in proportion to the remaining years of the asset’s life.

P4L are investigating the \nconstruction of a new plant to produce vehicle parts. P4L operate in a country where there are four \ndifferent methods possible for tax depreciation. P4L can choose to depreciate under any of these four \nmethods. Once selected, which method is chosen can not be changed and must be used for all asset \nclasses. \nYou will need to develop a model to forecast the depreciation and net book value of P4L’s assets under \neach method. The model will be annual and cover 20 years from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2036. \nThe key model inputs (discussed below) have been provided to you in the Excel file titled \n‘MO16 Round 2 - Sec 4 - Maximize the Benefit.xlsx’. \nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE \nP4L will own assets in five different classes (A, B, C, D, E). The new plant will have capital expenditure \nacross each of these five asset classes. There is no existing asset balance for any asset class. \nThe capital expenditure profile for each asset class is provided in the supporting Excel file. This capital \nexpenditure is real as at 1 January 2017. These values should be inflated by 2% per annum on 1 January \nof each year from 1 January 2018 onwards. \nAssume all capital expenditure occurs at the start of the year. There is no salvage value or residual value \nfor any asset class. \nDEPRECIATION ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS \nThe four depreciations methods possible are: \n1. Declining balance (also known as diminishing value). \n2. Straight line \n3. Units of production \n4. Sum of the years \nThe key assumptions for each method by asset class are provided in the supporting Excel file and in the \ntable below: \n \nMethod                  Declining balance                 Straight line                        Units of production      Sum of the years\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnit                    Annual %                           Useful life, years                  See Excel file           Useful life, years\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClass A                 40%                                12 years                            See Excel file           12 years\nClass B                 5%                                 9 years                             See Excel file           9 years\nClass C                 15%                                7 years                             See Excel file           7 years\nClass D                 20%                                15 years                            See Excel file           15 years\nClass E                 15%                                24 years                            See Excel file           24 years\n\n \nDEPRECIATION METHOD EXAMPLES \nThe example used for this section will be for an asset purchased at the start of 2017 for $100: \n1) Declining balance \nThe asset is depreciated based on a % of the remaining asset balance.  \nExample – using a declining balance rate of 60% per annum \n\n\n \n2) Straight line \nThe asset is depreciated in an equal amount over each year of its useful life. \nExample – using a useful life of 3 years\n\nMethod                 2017         2018         2019         2020          Notes\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpening balance         -          40.00         16.00         6.40     The depreciation calculation\nAdditions             100.00         -             -             -      continues indefinitely.\nDepreciation          (60.00)      (24.00)       (9.60)       (3.84)\nClosing balance        40.00        16.00         6.40         2.56\n\n \n3) Units of production \nThe asset is depreciated in accordance with the % of its total lifetime units it produces each year. \nExample – using a depreciation profile of 70% in year 1, 20% in year 2 and 10% in year 3 \n\nMethod                 2017         2018         2019         2020          Notes\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpening balance         -          30.00         10.00          -     The depreciation profile of 70%,\nAdditions             100.00         -             -            -     20% and 10% is applied to the\nDepreciation          (70.00)      (20.00)       (10.00)         -    initial cost to calculate the\nClosing balance        30.00        10.00          -            -     annual depreciation.\n\n4) Sum of the years \nThe asset is depreciated in proportion to the remaining years of the asset’s life.

The project is \na residential real estate development of 1,630 houses in an area that the local council has identified as \nrequiring new residential housing. The land for the houses is being sold by the council to enable this \ndevelopment to be undertaken and the council is currently undertaking a sale process for this land. MORE \nis one of two developers in this land sale process. \nYou will need to develop a model to forecast the cash flows for the project. The model will be quarterly \nand cover four years (16 quarters) from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2020. \nThe key model inputs (discussed below) have been provided to you in the Excel file titled \n‘MO16 Round 1 - Sec 4 - Going Around in Circles.xlsx’. \nAssume that all cash flows occur on the last day in the quarter. No inflation should be applied. \nHOUSES \nThere are four different categories of houses to be built on the site. The size, construction cost and sales \nprice for each house category are summarised in the table below: \n\nCategory        Size                Construction cost             Sales price\n               Square metres          $ per square metre                  $\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCategory A          50                         2,600                   250,000\nCategory B          60                         2,400                   300,000\nCategory C          75                         2,300                   335,000\nCategory D          95                         2,500                   500,000\n\nThe number of houses built in each quarter is shown in the table below.

These are: \n• Land purchase costs in Quarter 1 of $80m. These are to be paid to the council.\n• Earthworks costs in Quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4 of $20m, $17.5m, $15m and $15m respectively.\n• Pre-construction costs in Quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4 of $2.5m, $5m, $7.5m, and $9m respectively.\n• Other costs of $2.5m per quarter in each of the first four quarters and $1m per quarter in the\nsubsequent eight quarters (Quarter 5 to Quarter 12) \n \nEQUITY FINANCING \nTotal equity funding of $40 million will be used for the project. This will be paid in at $10 million each \nquarter for the first four quarters. Debt will be drawn to fund all other costs. In quarters where the project \ngenerates cash, available cash is first used to repay any outstanding debt. Once the debt is fully repaid \nany remaining cash is distributed to the shareholders. \nFor questions 38 – 40, an alternative equity drawdown approach will be modelled. Under this, equity will \nbe drawn in each quarter at 20% of the funding required in that period until $40m equity is drawn. Once \nthe $40 million is fully drawn, debt will be drawn to fund all remaining financing requirements. \n \nDEBT FINANCING \nYou are currently in negotiations with a local bank to provide a debt facility for the project. The maximum \nsize of the facility will be a key output of your financial model.  \nThe facility will charge a 7% p.a. interest rate. The interest will be calculated on the opening balance each \nquarter. The interest rate for each quarter will be calculated on a (days in quarter) / (days in calendar year) \nbasis. \nThe facility will charge an arranging fee of $5 million paid at the end of the first quarter. \n\n \nThere are other fees that the bank may charge depending on the outcomes of the negotiation process. \nThese fees should not be included for questions 31 – 33 but should be incorporated for questions 34 and \n35 onwards respectively. These potential other fees are \n• \nChanging the arranging fee from a fixed $5 million to be equal to 2% of the maximum required \nfacility size. Incorporate this from question 34 onwards. \n• \nA commitment fee of 1.25% p.a. The commitment fee will be calculated on the undrawn facility \namount at the start of each quarter and paid at the end of the quarter. The commitment fee rate \nfor each quarter will be calculated on a (days in quarter) / (days in calendar year) basis. The fee \nwill be paid in every quarter until the end of the model (31 Dec 2020), even if the facility has been \nfully repaid. Incorporate this from question 35 onwards. \n \nFINANCING – ADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nTo assist you in answering this question, we provide the following additional information on the funding: \n• \nIn any given quarter, there will be some or all of the following: operating cash flow (positive or \nnegative cashflow), arranging fees (negative cashflow), commitment fees (negative cashflow) and \ninterest (negative cashflow). \n• \nWhere the sum total of these values is negative, this cashflow shortfall must be financed through \neither equity or debt. There are two different approaches to the sizing of the equity draw each \nquarter, as set out above. \n• \nWhere the sum total of these values is positive, this excess cashflow is first used to repay debt. \nOnce the debt facility is fully repaid, distributions to shareholders can be made. \n• \nYou will be required to calculate a quarterly closing debt facility balance to answer some of the \nquestions. This is an end of period calculation after all debt drawdowns and repayments are \nmade. The maximum facility size (used to calculate arranging and commitment fees) is the \nmaximum of the quarterly closing debt facility balances calculated. \nACCURACY OF ANSWERS \nComponents of this questions will likely require the calculations to iterate in order to get the correct \nsolution. The maximum change for an iteration should be no larger than $0.1 to ensure your answers are \naccurate. \n \nFor Questions 31 to 37, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 38 to 40, you are required to type in your answer. \n\nQuestion 31 What is the total construction cost for all houses produced in the quarter ended March 2019?

This will be paid in at $10 million each \nquarter for the first four quarters. Debt will be drawn to fund all other costs. In quarters where the project \ngenerates cash, available cash is first used to repay any outstanding debt. Once the debt is fully repaid \nany remaining cash is distributed to the shareholders. \nFor questions 38 – 40, an alternative equity drawdown approach will be modelled. Under this, equity will \nbe drawn in each quarter at 20% of the funding required in that period until $40m equity is drawn. Once \nthe $40 million is fully drawn, debt will be drawn to fund all remaining financing requirements. \n \nDEBT FINANCING \nYou are currently in negotiations with a local bank to provide a debt facility for the project. The maximum \nsize of the facility will be a key output of your financial model.  \nThe facility will charge a 7% p.a. interest rate. The interest will be calculated on the opening balance each \nquarter. The interest rate for each quarter will be calculated on a (days in quarter) / (days in calendar year) \nbasis. \nThe facility will charge an arranging fee of $5 million paid at the end of the first quarter. \n\n \nThere are other fees that the bank may charge depending on the outcomes of the negotiation process. \nThese fees should not be included for questions 31 – 33 but should be incorporated for questions 34 and \n35 onwards respectively. These potential other fees are \n• \nChanging the arranging fee from a fixed $5 million to be equal to 2% of the maximum required \nfacility size. Incorporate this from question 34 onwards. \n• \nA commitment fee of 1.25% p.a. The commitment fee will be calculated on the undrawn facility \namount at the start of each quarter and paid at the end of the quarter. The commitment fee rate \nfor each quarter will be calculated on a (days in quarter) / (days in calendar year) basis.

These are: \n• Land purchase costs in Quarter 1 of $80m. These are to be paid to the council.\n• Earthworks costs in Quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4 of $20m, $17.5m, $15m and $15m respectively.\n• Pre-construction costs in Quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4 of $2.5m, $5m, $7.5m, and $9m respectively.\n• Other costs of $2.5m per quarter in each of the first four quarters and $1m per quarter in the\nsubsequent eight quarters (Quarter 5 to Quarter 12) \n \nEQUITY FINANCING \nTotal equity funding of $40 million will be used for the project. This will be paid in at $10 million each \nquarter for the first four quarters. Debt will be drawn to fund all other costs. In quarters where the project \ngenerates cash, available cash is first used to repay any outstanding debt. Once the debt is fully repaid \nany remaining cash is distributed to the shareholders. \nFor questions 38 – 40, an alternative equity drawdown approach will be modelled. Under this, equity will \nbe drawn in each quarter at 20% of the funding required in that period until $40m equity is drawn. Once \nthe $40 million is fully drawn, debt will be drawn to fund all remaining financing requirements. \n \nDEBT FINANCING \nYou are currently in negotiations with a local bank to provide a debt facility for the project. The maximum \nsize of the facility will be a key output of your financial model.  \nThe facility will charge a 7% p.a. interest rate. The interest will be calculated on the opening balance each \nquarter. The interest rate for each quarter will be calculated on a (days in quarter) / (days in calendar year) \nbasis. \nThe facility will charge an arranging fee of $5 million paid at the end of the first quarter. \n\n \nThere are other fees that the bank may charge depending on the outcomes of the negotiation process. \nThese fees should not be included for questions 31 – 33 but should be incorporated for questions 34 and \n35 onwards respectively. These potential other fees are \n• \nChanging the arranging fee from a fixed $5 million to be equal to 2% of the maximum required \nfacility size. Incorporate this from question 34 onwards. \n• \nA commitment fee of 1.25% p.a. The commitment fee will be calculated on the undrawn facility \namount at the start of each quarter and paid at the end of the quarter. The commitment fee rate \nfor each quarter will be calculated on a (days in quarter) / (days in calendar year) basis. The fee \nwill be paid in every quarter until the end of the model (31 Dec 2020), even if the facility has been \nfully repaid. Incorporate this from question 35 onwards. \n \nFINANCING – ADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nTo assist you in answering this question, we provide the following additional information on the funding: \n• \nIn any given quarter, there will be some or all of the following: operating cash flow (positive or \nnegative cashflow), arranging fees (negative cashflow), commitment fees (negative cashflow) and \ninterest (negative cashflow). \n• \nWhere the sum total of these values is negative, this cashflow shortfall must be financed through \neither equity or debt. There are two different approaches to the sizing of the equity draw each \nquarter, as set out above. \n• \nWhere the sum total of these values is positive, this excess cashflow is first used to repay debt. \nOnce the debt facility is fully repaid, distributions to shareholders can be made. \n• \nYou will be required to calculate a quarterly closing debt facility balance to answer some of the \nquestions. This is an end of period calculation after all debt drawdowns and repayments are \nmade. The maximum facility size (used to calculate arranging and commitment fees) is the \nmaximum of the quarterly closing debt facility balances calculated. \nACCURACY OF ANSWERS \nComponents of this questions will likely require the calculations to iterate in order to get the correct \nsolution. The maximum change for an iteration should be no larger than $0.1 to ensure your answers are \naccurate. \n \nFor Questions 31 to 37, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 38 to 40, you are required to type in your answer. \n\nQuestion 35 If the commitment fee is introduced, what will be the total size of the debt facility (rounded to the nearest dollar)?

These are: \n• Land purchase costs in Quarter 1 of $80m. These are to be paid to the council.\n• Earthworks costs in Quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4 of $20m, $17.5m, $15m and $15m respectively.\n• Pre-construction costs in Quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4 of $2.5m, $5m, $7.5m, and $9m respectively.\n• Other costs of $2.5m per quarter in each of the first four quarters and $1m per quarter in the\nsubsequent eight quarters (Quarter 5 to Quarter 12) \n \nEQUITY FINANCING \nTotal equity funding of $40 million will be used for the project. This will be paid in at $10 million each \nquarter for the first four quarters. Debt will be drawn to fund all other costs. In quarters where the project \ngenerates cash, available cash is first used to repay any outstanding debt. Once the debt is fully repaid \nany remaining cash is distributed to the shareholders. \nFor questions 38 – 40, an alternative equity drawdown approach will be modelled. Under this, equity will \nbe drawn in each quarter at 20% of the funding required in that period until $40m equity is drawn. Once \nthe $40 million is fully drawn, debt will be drawn to fund all remaining financing requirements. \n \nDEBT FINANCING \nYou are currently in negotiations with a local bank to provide a debt facility for the project. The maximum \nsize of the facility will be a key output of your financial model.  \nThe facility will charge a 7% p.a. interest rate. The interest will be calculated on the opening balance each \nquarter. The interest rate for each quarter will be calculated on a (days in quarter) / (days in calendar year) \nbasis. \nThe facility will charge an arranging fee of $5 million paid at the end of the first quarter. \n\n \nThere are other fees that the bank may charge depending on the outcomes of the negotiation process. \nThese fees should not be included for questions 31 – 33 but should be incorporated for questions 34 and \n35 onwards respectively. These potential other fees are \n• \nChanging the arranging fee from a fixed $5 million to be equal to 2% of the maximum required \nfacility size. Incorporate this from question 34 onwards. \n• \nA commitment fee of 1.25% p.a. The commitment fee will be calculated on the undrawn facility \namount at the start of each quarter and paid at the end of the quarter. The commitment fee rate \nfor each quarter will be calculated on a (days in quarter) / (days in calendar year) basis. The fee \nwill be paid in every quarter until the end of the model (31 Dec 2020), even if the facility has been \nfully repaid. Incorporate this from question 35 onwards. \n \nFINANCING – ADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nTo assist you in answering this question, we provide the following additional information on the funding: \n• \nIn any given quarter, there will be some or all of the following: operating cash flow (positive or \nnegative cashflow), arranging fees (negative cashflow), commitment fees (negative cashflow) and \ninterest (negative cashflow). \n• \nWhere the sum total of these values is negative, this cashflow shortfall must be financed through \neither equity or debt. There are two different approaches to the sizing of the equity draw each \nquarter, as set out above. \n• \nWhere the sum total of these values is positive, this excess cashflow is first used to repay debt. \nOnce the debt facility is fully repaid, distributions to shareholders can be made. \n• \nYou will be required to calculate a quarterly closing debt facility balance to answer some of the \nquestions. This is an end of period calculation after all debt drawdowns and repayments are \nmade. The maximum facility size (used to calculate arranging and commitment fees) is the \nmaximum of the quarterly closing debt facility balances calculated. \nACCURACY OF ANSWERS \nComponents of this questions will likely require the calculations to iterate in order to get the correct \nsolution. The maximum change for an iteration should be no larger than $0.1 to ensure your answers are \naccurate. \n \nFor Questions 31 to 37, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 38 to 40, you are required to type in your answer. \n\nQuestion 40 To make their bid more appealing, MORE are considering setting their required IRR to 12% to increase the price that can be paid to the council for the land. What land purchase price will achieve an equity IRR of 12% (using the XIRR function)? Round your answer to the nearest $100,000.\nType in your answer, without any dollar signs or thousands separator. E.g. $1,000,000 should be typed as 1000000. Remember to round your answer to the nearest $100,000!

They have already worked out their forecast taxable \nprofit amount in each month from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2025, but need you to calculate the \nforecast tax obligations and payments for each relevant period. The company has no trading history in this \ncountry and therefore no tax payments are due from pre-2015 operations. Tax payments will commence \nfrom the 2016 calendar year, based on the taxable profit from the previous calendar year and the \ncompany tax rates and tax rules as set out below. \nThe monthly taxable profit figures and all the inputs below are provided in the workbook for this case \nstudy. \nThe government has announced that the company tax rate will change frequently over the next 10 years \nas follows: \n\nDate start          Date end                   Company tax rate applicable\n1 January 2015      31 March 2015              15%\n1 April 2015        17 May 2016                14%\n18 May 2016         22 September 2016          17%\n23 September 2016   31 March 2019              18%\n1 April 2019        15 August 2020             19%\n16 August 2020      11 November 2020           18%\n12 November 2020    2 February 2021            14%\n3 February 2021     30 June 2021               18%\n1 July 2021         2 February 2022            14%\n3 February 2022     22 February 2022           15%\n23 February 2022    31 March 2024              12%\n1 April 2024        15 May 2025                11%\n16 May 2025         Onwards                    12%\n \nFor months where more than one tax rate is applicable, you should determine an average rate to apply \nweighted by the number of days which the relevant tax rate applies to that month.\n\nThe tax charge in each period is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate to the taxable profit \nprofile given in the inputs booklet\n\nThe tax payable is calculated by adjusting the tax charge for losses, which are added a tax loss pool \nwhich works as follows: \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are no losses available in the pool, tax payable in\nthat month is equal to the tax charge. \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are losses available in the pool, the tax payable\nin the month is the tax charge reduced by the lesser of the amount of the charge and the balance \nof the tax loss pool.  Any losses used in this way must be removed from the tax loss pool. \n If the tax charge in a month is negative it should be added to the tax loss pool and the tax payable\nin that month is zero. \nAssume that the balance in the tax loss pool at the start of the modeled timeline is zero. \nOnce you have calculated the tax payable in each month, you must annualize it to calculate the \ncompany’s tax liability for a year.  The company’s tax year is the calendar year. \nThe annual tax liability is then paid in the subsequent calendar year in the following proportions: \n 60% in April\n 25% in August\n 15% in December\nThe following section is only relevant to questions 39-41. \nThe government is considering a change to tax legislation as follows: \nIf a tax loss is not used within two years after it was created it expires and must be removed from the tax \nloss pool.  For example, if a loss is created in April 2015 and has not been used by the end of April 2017 it \nwill expire at the end of April 2017.  Assume that losses are used and expired in order or age (oldest first). \nYou have been asked to determine what the impact of this would be on the company’s tax payments. \n\nQuestion 32 \nWhat is the tax rate that will be applicable in February 2022 ?

They have already worked out their forecast taxable \nprofit amount in each month from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2025, but need you to calculate the \nforecast tax obligations and payments for each relevant period. The company has no trading history in this \ncountry and therefore no tax payments are due from pre-2015 operations. Tax payments will commence \nfrom the 2016 calendar year, based on the taxable profit from the previous calendar year and the \ncompany tax rates and tax rules as set out below. \nThe monthly taxable profit figures and all the inputs below are provided in the workbook for this case \nstudy. \nThe government has announced that the company tax rate will change frequently over the next 10 years \nas follows: \n\nDate start          Date end                   Company tax rate applicable\n1 January 2015      31 March 2015              15%\n1 April 2015        17 May 2016                14%\n18 May 2016         22 September 2016          17%\n23 September 2016   31 March 2019              18%\n1 April 2019        15 August 2020             19%\n16 August 2020      11 November 2020           18%\n12 November 2020    2 February 2021            14%\n3 February 2021     30 June 2021               18%\n1 July 2021         2 February 2022            14%\n3 February 2022     22 February 2022           15%\n23 February 2022    31 March 2024              12%\n1 April 2024        15 May 2025                11%\n16 May 2025         Onwards                    12%\n \nFor months where more than one tax rate is applicable, you should determine an average rate to apply \nweighted by the number of days which the relevant tax rate applies to that month.\n\nThe tax charge in each period is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate to the taxable profit \nprofile given in the inputs booklet\n\nThe tax payable is calculated by adjusting the tax charge for losses, which are added a tax loss pool \nwhich works as follows: \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are no losses available in the pool, tax payable in\nthat month is equal to the tax charge. \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are losses available in the pool, the tax payable\nin the month is the tax charge reduced by the lesser of the amount of the charge and the balance \nof the tax loss pool.  Any losses used in this way must be removed from the tax loss pool. \n If the tax charge in a month is negative it should be added to the tax loss pool and the tax payable\nin that month is zero. \nAssume that the balance in the tax loss pool at the start of the modeled timeline is zero. \nOnce you have calculated the tax payable in each month, you must annualize it to calculate the \ncompany’s tax liability for a year.  The company’s tax year is the calendar year. \nThe annual tax liability is then paid in the subsequent calendar year in the following proportions: \n 60% in April\n 25% in August\n 15% in December\nThe following section is only relevant to questions 39-41. \nThe government is considering a change to tax legislation as follows: \nIf a tax loss is not used within two years after it was created it expires and must be removed from the tax \nloss pool.  For example, if a loss is created in April 2015 and has not been used by the end of April 2017 it \nwill expire at the end of April 2017.

They have already worked out their forecast taxable \nprofit amount in each month from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2025, but need you to calculate the \nforecast tax obligations and payments for each relevant period. The company has no trading history in this \ncountry and therefore no tax payments are due from pre-2015 operations. Tax payments will commence \nfrom the 2016 calendar year, based on the taxable profit from the previous calendar year and the \ncompany tax rates and tax rules as set out below. \nThe monthly taxable profit figures and all the inputs below are provided in the workbook for this case \nstudy. \nThe government has announced that the company tax rate will change frequently over the next 10 years \nas follows: \n\nDate start          Date end                   Company tax rate applicable\n1 January 2015      31 March 2015              15%\n1 April 2015        17 May 2016                14%\n18 May 2016         22 September 2016          17%\n23 September 2016   31 March 2019              18%\n1 April 2019        15 August 2020             19%\n16 August 2020      11 November 2020           18%\n12 November 2020    2 February 2021            14%\n3 February 2021     30 June 2021               18%\n1 July 2021         2 February 2022            14%\n3 February 2022     22 February 2022           15%\n23 February 2022    31 March 2024              12%\n1 April 2024        15 May 2025                11%\n16 May 2025         Onwards                    12%\n \nFor months where more than one tax rate is applicable, you should determine an average rate to apply \nweighted by the number of days which the relevant tax rate applies to that month.\n\nThe tax charge in each period is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate to the taxable profit \nprofile given in the inputs booklet\n\nThe tax payable is calculated by adjusting the tax charge for losses, which are added a tax loss pool \nwhich works as follows: \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are no losses available in the pool, tax payable in\nthat month is equal to the tax charge. \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are losses available in the pool, the tax payable\nin the month is the tax charge reduced by the lesser of the amount of the charge and the balance \nof the tax loss pool.  Any losses used in this way must be removed from the tax loss pool. \n If the tax charge in a month is negative it should be added to the tax loss pool and the tax payable\nin that month is zero. \nAssume that the balance in the tax loss pool at the start of the modeled timeline is zero. \nOnce you have calculated the tax payable in each month, you must annualize it to calculate the \ncompany’s tax liability for a year.  The company’s tax year is the calendar year. \nThe annual tax liability is then paid in the subsequent calendar year in the following proportions: \n 60% in April\n 25% in August\n 15% in December\nThe following section is only relevant to questions 39-41. \nThe government is considering a change to tax legislation as follows: \nIf a tax loss is not used within two years after it was created it expires and must be removed from the tax \nloss pool.  For example, if a loss is created in April 2015 and has not been used by the end of April 2017 it \nwill expire at the end of April 2017.

They have already worked out their forecast taxable \nprofit amount in each month from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2025, but need you to calculate the \nforecast tax obligations and payments for each relevant period. The company has no trading history in this \ncountry and therefore no tax payments are due from pre-2015 operations. Tax payments will commence \nfrom the 2016 calendar year, based on the taxable profit from the previous calendar year and the \ncompany tax rates and tax rules as set out below. \nThe monthly taxable profit figures and all the inputs below are provided in the workbook for this case \nstudy. \nThe government has announced that the company tax rate will change frequently over the next 10 years \nas follows: \n\nDate start          Date end                   Company tax rate applicable\n1 January 2015      31 March 2015              15%\n1 April 2015        17 May 2016                14%\n18 May 2016         22 September 2016          17%\n23 September 2016   31 March 2019              18%\n1 April 2019        15 August 2020             19%\n16 August 2020      11 November 2020           18%\n12 November 2020    2 February 2021            14%\n3 February 2021     30 June 2021               18%\n1 July 2021         2 February 2022            14%\n3 February 2022     22 February 2022           15%\n23 February 2022    31 March 2024              12%\n1 April 2024        15 May 2025                11%\n16 May 2025         Onwards                    12%\n \nFor months where more than one tax rate is applicable, you should determine an average rate to apply \nweighted by the number of days which the relevant tax rate applies to that month.\n\nThe tax charge in each period is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate to the taxable profit \nprofile given in the inputs booklet\n\nThe tax payable is calculated by adjusting the tax charge for losses, which are added a tax loss pool \nwhich works as follows: \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are no losses available in the pool, tax payable in\nthat month is equal to the tax charge. \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are losses available in the pool, the tax payable\nin the month is the tax charge reduced by the lesser of the amount of the charge and the balance \nof the tax loss pool.  Any losses used in this way must be removed from the tax loss pool. \n If the tax charge in a month is negative it should be added to the tax loss pool and the tax payable\nin that month is zero. \nAssume that the balance in the tax loss pool at the start of the modeled timeline is zero. \nOnce you have calculated the tax payable in each month, you must annualize it to calculate the \ncompany’s tax liability for a year.  The company’s tax year is the calendar year. \nThe annual tax liability is then paid in the subsequent calendar year in the following proportions: \n 60% in April\n 25% in August\n 15% in December\nThe following section is only relevant to questions 39-41. \nThe government is considering a change to tax legislation as follows: \nIf a tax loss is not used within two years after it was created it expires and must be removed from the tax \nloss pool.  For example, if a loss is created in April 2015 and has not been used by the end of April 2017 it \nwill expire at the end of April 2017.

They have already worked out their forecast taxable \nprofit amount in each month from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2025, but need you to calculate the \nforecast tax obligations and payments for each relevant period. The company has no trading history in this \ncountry and therefore no tax payments are due from pre-2015 operations. Tax payments will commence \nfrom the 2016 calendar year, based on the taxable profit from the previous calendar year and the \ncompany tax rates and tax rules as set out below. \nThe monthly taxable profit figures and all the inputs below are provided in the workbook for this case \nstudy. \nThe government has announced that the company tax rate will change frequently over the next 10 years \nas follows: \n\nDate start          Date end                   Company tax rate applicable\n1 January 2015      31 March 2015              15%\n1 April 2015        17 May 2016                14%\n18 May 2016         22 September 2016          17%\n23 September 2016   31 March 2019              18%\n1 April 2019        15 August 2020             19%\n16 August 2020      11 November 2020           18%\n12 November 2020    2 February 2021            14%\n3 February 2021     30 June 2021               18%\n1 July 2021         2 February 2022            14%\n3 February 2022     22 February 2022           15%\n23 February 2022    31 March 2024              12%\n1 April 2024        15 May 2025                11%\n16 May 2025         Onwards                    12%\n \nFor months where more than one tax rate is applicable, you should determine an average rate to apply \nweighted by the number of days which the relevant tax rate applies to that month.\n\nThe tax charge in each period is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate to the taxable profit \nprofile given in the inputs booklet\n\nThe tax payable is calculated by adjusting the tax charge for losses, which are added a tax loss pool \nwhich works as follows: \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are no losses available in the pool, tax payable in\nthat month is equal to the tax charge. \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are losses available in the pool, the tax payable\nin the month is the tax charge reduced by the lesser of the amount of the charge and the balance \nof the tax loss pool.  Any losses used in this way must be removed from the tax loss pool. \n If the tax charge in a month is negative it should be added to the tax loss pool and the tax payable\nin that month is zero. \nAssume that the balance in the tax loss pool at the start of the modeled timeline is zero. \nOnce you have calculated the tax payable in each month, you must annualize it to calculate the \ncompany’s tax liability for a year.  The company’s tax year is the calendar year. \nThe annual tax liability is then paid in the subsequent calendar year in the following proportions: \n 60% in April\n 25% in August\n 15% in December\nThe following section is only relevant to questions 39-41. \nThe government is considering a change to tax legislation as follows: \nIf a tax loss is not used within two years after it was created it expires and must be removed from the tax \nloss pool.  For example, if a loss is created in April 2015 and has not been used by the end of April 2017 it \nwill expire at the end of April 2017.

They have already worked out their forecast taxable \nprofit amount in each month from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2025, but need you to calculate the \nforecast tax obligations and payments for each relevant period. The company has no trading history in this \ncountry and therefore no tax payments are due from pre-2015 operations. Tax payments will commence \nfrom the 2016 calendar year, based on the taxable profit from the previous calendar year and the \ncompany tax rates and tax rules as set out below. \nThe monthly taxable profit figures and all the inputs below are provided in the workbook for this case \nstudy. \nThe government has announced that the company tax rate will change frequently over the next 10 years \nas follows: \n\nDate start          Date end                   Company tax rate applicable\n1 January 2015      31 March 2015              15%\n1 April 2015        17 May 2016                14%\n18 May 2016         22 September 2016          17%\n23 September 2016   31 March 2019              18%\n1 April 2019        15 August 2020             19%\n16 August 2020      11 November 2020           18%\n12 November 2020    2 February 2021            14%\n3 February 2021     30 June 2021               18%\n1 July 2021         2 February 2022            14%\n3 February 2022     22 February 2022           15%\n23 February 2022    31 March 2024              12%\n1 April 2024        15 May 2025                11%\n16 May 2025         Onwards                    12%\n \nFor months where more than one tax rate is applicable, you should determine an average rate to apply \nweighted by the number of days which the relevant tax rate applies to that month.\n\nThe tax charge in each period is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate to the taxable profit \nprofile given in the inputs booklet\n\nThe tax payable is calculated by adjusting the tax charge for losses, which are added a tax loss pool \nwhich works as follows: \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are no losses available in the pool, tax payable in\nthat month is equal to the tax charge. \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are losses available in the pool, the tax payable\nin the month is the tax charge reduced by the lesser of the amount of the charge and the balance \nof the tax loss pool.  Any losses used in this way must be removed from the tax loss pool. \n If the tax charge in a month is negative it should be added to the tax loss pool and the tax payable\nin that month is zero. \nAssume that the balance in the tax loss pool at the start of the modeled timeline is zero. \nOnce you have calculated the tax payable in each month, you must annualize it to calculate the \ncompany’s tax liability for a year.  The company’s tax year is the calendar year. \nThe annual tax liability is then paid in the subsequent calendar year in the following proportions: \n 60% in April\n 25% in August\n 15% in December\nThe following section is only relevant to questions 39-41. \nThe government is considering a change to tax legislation as follows: \nIf a tax loss is not used within two years after it was created it expires and must be removed from the tax \nloss pool.  For example, if a loss is created in April 2015 and has not been used by the end of April 2017 it \nwill expire at the end of April 2017.

They have already worked out their forecast taxable \nprofit amount in each month from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2025, but need you to calculate the \nforecast tax obligations and payments for each relevant period. The company has no trading history in this \ncountry and therefore no tax payments are due from pre-2015 operations. Tax payments will commence \nfrom the 2016 calendar year, based on the taxable profit from the previous calendar year and the \ncompany tax rates and tax rules as set out below. \nThe monthly taxable profit figures and all the inputs below are provided in the workbook for this case \nstudy. \nThe government has announced that the company tax rate will change frequently over the next 10 years \nas follows: \n\nDate start          Date end                   Company tax rate applicable\n1 January 2015      31 March 2015              15%\n1 April 2015        17 May 2016                14%\n18 May 2016         22 September 2016          17%\n23 September 2016   31 March 2019              18%\n1 April 2019        15 August 2020             19%\n16 August 2020      11 November 2020           18%\n12 November 2020    2 February 2021            14%\n3 February 2021     30 June 2021               18%\n1 July 2021         2 February 2022            14%\n3 February 2022     22 February 2022           15%\n23 February 2022    31 March 2024              12%\n1 April 2024        15 May 2025                11%\n16 May 2025         Onwards                    12%\n \nFor months where more than one tax rate is applicable, you should determine an average rate to apply \nweighted by the number of days which the relevant tax rate applies to that month.\n\nThe tax charge in each period is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate to the taxable profit \nprofile given in the inputs booklet\n\nThe tax payable is calculated by adjusting the tax charge for losses, which are added a tax loss pool \nwhich works as follows: \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are no losses available in the pool, tax payable in\nthat month is equal to the tax charge. \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are losses available in the pool, the tax payable\nin the month is the tax charge reduced by the lesser of the amount of the charge and the balance \nof the tax loss pool.  Any losses used in this way must be removed from the tax loss pool. \n If the tax charge in a month is negative it should be added to the tax loss pool and the tax payable\nin that month is zero. \nAssume that the balance in the tax loss pool at the start of the modeled timeline is zero. \nOnce you have calculated the tax payable in each month, you must annualize it to calculate the \ncompany’s tax liability for a year.  The company’s tax year is the calendar year. \nThe annual tax liability is then paid in the subsequent calendar year in the following proportions: \n 60% in April\n 25% in August\n 15% in December\nThe following section is only relevant to questions 39-41. \nThe government is considering a change to tax legislation as follows: \nIf a tax loss is not used within two years after it was created it expires and must be removed from the tax \nloss pool.  For example, if a loss is created in April 2015 and has not been used by the end of April 2017 it \nwill expire at the end of April 2017.

They have already worked out their forecast taxable \nprofit amount in each month from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2025, but need you to calculate the \nforecast tax obligations and payments for each relevant period. The company has no trading history in this \ncountry and therefore no tax payments are due from pre-2015 operations. Tax payments will commence \nfrom the 2016 calendar year, based on the taxable profit from the previous calendar year and the \ncompany tax rates and tax rules as set out below. \nThe monthly taxable profit figures and all the inputs below are provided in the workbook for this case \nstudy. \nThe government has announced that the company tax rate will change frequently over the next 10 years \nas follows: \n\nDate start          Date end                   Company tax rate applicable\n1 January 2015      31 March 2015              15%\n1 April 2015        17 May 2016                14%\n18 May 2016         22 September 2016          17%\n23 September 2016   31 March 2019              18%\n1 April 2019        15 August 2020             19%\n16 August 2020      11 November 2020           18%\n12 November 2020    2 February 2021            14%\n3 February 2021     30 June 2021               18%\n1 July 2021         2 February 2022            14%\n3 February 2022     22 February 2022           15%\n23 February 2022    31 March 2024              12%\n1 April 2024        15 May 2025                11%\n16 May 2025         Onwards                    12%\n \nFor months where more than one tax rate is applicable, you should determine an average rate to apply \nweighted by the number of days which the relevant tax rate applies to that month.\n\nThe tax charge in each period is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate to the taxable profit \nprofile given in the inputs booklet\n\nThe tax payable is calculated by adjusting the tax charge for losses, which are added a tax loss pool \nwhich works as follows: \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are no losses available in the pool, tax payable in\nthat month is equal to the tax charge. \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are losses available in the pool, the tax payable\nin the month is the tax charge reduced by the lesser of the amount of the charge and the balance \nof the tax loss pool.  Any losses used in this way must be removed from the tax loss pool. \n If the tax charge in a month is negative it should be added to the tax loss pool and the tax payable\nin that month is zero. \nAssume that the balance in the tax loss pool at the start of the modeled timeline is zero. \nOnce you have calculated the tax payable in each month, you must annualize it to calculate the \ncompany’s tax liability for a year.  The company’s tax year is the calendar year. \nThe annual tax liability is then paid in the subsequent calendar year in the following proportions: \n 60% in April\n 25% in August\n 15% in December\nThe following section is only relevant to questions 39-41. \nThe government is considering a change to tax legislation as follows: \nIf a tax loss is not used within two years after it was created it expires and must be removed from the tax \nloss pool.  For example, if a loss is created in April 2015 and has not been used by the end of April 2017 it \nwill expire at the end of April 2017.

They have already worked out their forecast taxable \nprofit amount in each month from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2025, but need you to calculate the \nforecast tax obligations and payments for each relevant period. The company has no trading history in this \ncountry and therefore no tax payments are due from pre-2015 operations. Tax payments will commence \nfrom the 2016 calendar year, based on the taxable profit from the previous calendar year and the \ncompany tax rates and tax rules as set out below. \nThe monthly taxable profit figures and all the inputs below are provided in the workbook for this case \nstudy. \nThe government has announced that the company tax rate will change frequently over the next 10 years \nas follows: \n\nDate start          Date end                   Company tax rate applicable\n1 January 2015      31 March 2015              15%\n1 April 2015        17 May 2016                14%\n18 May 2016         22 September 2016          17%\n23 September 2016   31 March 2019              18%\n1 April 2019        15 August 2020             19%\n16 August 2020      11 November 2020           18%\n12 November 2020    2 February 2021            14%\n3 February 2021     30 June 2021               18%\n1 July 2021         2 February 2022            14%\n3 February 2022     22 February 2022           15%\n23 February 2022    31 March 2024              12%\n1 April 2024        15 May 2025                11%\n16 May 2025         Onwards                    12%\n \nFor months where more than one tax rate is applicable, you should determine an average rate to apply \nweighted by the number of days which the relevant tax rate applies to that month.\n\nThe tax charge in each period is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate to the taxable profit \nprofile given in the inputs booklet\n\nThe tax payable is calculated by adjusting the tax charge for losses, which are added a tax loss pool \nwhich works as follows: \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are no losses available in the pool, tax payable in\nthat month is equal to the tax charge. \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are losses available in the pool, the tax payable\nin the month is the tax charge reduced by the lesser of the amount of the charge and the balance \nof the tax loss pool.  Any losses used in this way must be removed from the tax loss pool. \n If the tax charge in a month is negative it should be added to the tax loss pool and the tax payable\nin that month is zero. \nAssume that the balance in the tax loss pool at the start of the modeled timeline is zero. \nOnce you have calculated the tax payable in each month, you must annualize it to calculate the \ncompany’s tax liability for a year.  The company’s tax year is the calendar year. \nThe annual tax liability is then paid in the subsequent calendar year in the following proportions: \n 60% in April\n 25% in August\n 15% in December\nThe following section is only relevant to questions 39-41. \nThe government is considering a change to tax legislation as follows: \nIf a tax loss is not used within two years after it was created it expires and must be removed from the tax \nloss pool.  For example, if a loss is created in April 2015 and has not been used by the end of April 2017 it \nwill expire at the end of April 2017.

They have already worked out their forecast taxable \nprofit amount in each month from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2025, but need you to calculate the \nforecast tax obligations and payments for each relevant period. The company has no trading history in this \ncountry and therefore no tax payments are due from pre-2015 operations. Tax payments will commence \nfrom the 2016 calendar year, based on the taxable profit from the previous calendar year and the \ncompany tax rates and tax rules as set out below. \nThe monthly taxable profit figures and all the inputs below are provided in the workbook for this case \nstudy. \nThe government has announced that the company tax rate will change frequently over the next 10 years \nas follows: \n\nDate start          Date end                   Company tax rate applicable\n1 January 2015      31 March 2015              15%\n1 April 2015        17 May 2016                14%\n18 May 2016         22 September 2016          17%\n23 September 2016   31 March 2019              18%\n1 April 2019        15 August 2020             19%\n16 August 2020      11 November 2020           18%\n12 November 2020    2 February 2021            14%\n3 February 2021     30 June 2021               18%\n1 July 2021         2 February 2022            14%\n3 February 2022     22 February 2022           15%\n23 February 2022    31 March 2024              12%\n1 April 2024        15 May 2025                11%\n16 May 2025         Onwards                    12%\n \nFor months where more than one tax rate is applicable, you should determine an average rate to apply \nweighted by the number of days which the relevant tax rate applies to that month.\n\nThe tax charge in each period is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate to the taxable profit \nprofile given in the inputs booklet\n\nThe tax payable is calculated by adjusting the tax charge for losses, which are added a tax loss pool \nwhich works as follows: \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are no losses available in the pool, tax payable in\nthat month is equal to the tax charge. \n If the tax charge in a month is positive and there are losses available in the pool, the tax payable\nin the month is the tax charge reduced by the lesser of the amount of the charge and the balance \nof the tax loss pool.  Any losses used in this way must be removed from the tax loss pool. \n If the tax charge in a month is negative it should be added to the tax loss pool and the tax payable\nin that month is zero. \nAssume that the balance in the tax loss pool at the start of the modeled timeline is zero. \nOnce you have calculated the tax payable in each month, you must annualize it to calculate the \ncompany’s tax liability for a year.  The company’s tax year is the calendar year. \nThe annual tax liability is then paid in the subsequent calendar year in the following proportions: \n 60% in April\n 25% in August\n 15% in December\nThe following section is only relevant to questions 39-41. \nThe government is considering a change to tax legislation as follows: \nIf a tax loss is not used within two years after it was created it expires and must be removed from the tax \nloss pool.  For example, if a loss is created in April 2015 and has not been used by the end of April 2017 it \nwill expire at the end of April 2017.  Assume that losses are used and expired in order or age (oldest first). \nYou have been asked to determine what the impact of this would be on the company’s tax payments. \n\nQuestion 41 \nConsidering tax loss expiry, what is the forecast total tax paid up to and including 31 December \n2025 ?

As part of the tender submission the consortium is \nrequired to bid the amount of revenue it would like OpCo to receive in order to operate and maintain the \nasset. \nYour task is to: \n Model the year 1 expenses in accordance with the data below.\n Model the growth profile of the expenses over the contract life.\n Model the additional Lifecycle Costs (non-recurring one-off expenditure relating to major maintenance\nwork). \n Back solve the necessary bid values for the revenue stream, in order to meet the consortium’s internal\nrevenue sizing conditions. \nYou will probably need to build a simple Cash Flow statement of OpCo in order to complete this task. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed expenses of OpCo, the escalation assumptions for \nboth revenues and expenses, as well as general model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case \nstudy questions. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be a quarterly model spanning 15 calendar years, from 1 January 2016 to 31\nDecember 2030. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all book entries and cashflows occur on the final day of the\nquarter. \n \nRevenues \n Revenues are based on two bid values called Base Payment 1 (“BP1”) and Base Payment 2 (“BP2”)\n BP1 and BP2 are annual amounts, expressed in real January 2016 dollars.\n Revenue payments are made every quarter.  The amount paid each quarter end date is equal to\n \nPayment each quarter = (BP1 * 0.25 * IF1) + (BP2 * 0.25 * IF2) \n IF1 and IF2 refer to Indexation Factor 1 and Indexation Factor 2 (see below).\n\nExpenses \n Expenses are categorised in four types:\no Labour, which escalates at Indexation Factor 3 (“IF3”)\no Materials, which escalates at Indexation Factor 4 (“IF4”)\no Other Expenses, which escalates at Indexation Factor 5 (“IF5”)\no Profit Margin, which is sized as a set percentage of the total of the other three expense\ncategories.  This represents a regular and required payment to OpCo’s parent companies. \n Labour Expenses per quarter are $2,500,000 * IF3\n Materials Expenses per quarter are $1,750,000 * IF4\n Other Expenses per quarter are $750,000 * IF5\n Profit Margin Expenses each quarter are 9.00% of the total of Labour, Materials and Other Expenses.\n \nLifecycle Costs \n On 31 December 2021, lifecycle costs of $10,000,000 are incurred (no further escalation needs to be\napplied to this amount). \n On 30 June 2028, lifecycle costs of $5,000,000 are incurred (no further escalation needs to be applied\nto this amount). \n Assume these amounts are fully expensed at the time they are incurred, and are not depreciated.  No\nprofit margin is earned on the Lifecycle Costs. \n \nEscalation and Indexation \n IF1 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.2% every subsequent 1 January.\n IF2 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 4.0% every subsequent 1 January.\n IF3 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 4.8% every 1 July\n IF4 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.5% every subsequent 1 January\n IF5 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.0% every 1 July\n \nDebt \n All of OpCo’s Expenses and Lifecycle Costs are paid for by cash at the end of each quarter, after\nreceiving the Revenue Payments for that quarter. \n If required, OpCo has access to a short term revolving debt facility.  Any cash shortfall after paying\nexpenses and lifecycle costs is borrowed from the facility at the end of each quarter.  Any excess cash \nremaining after paying expenses and lifecycle costs is applied towards any outstanding balance of the \ndebt facility.   \n When the facility is drawn, interest is charged each quarter at a rate of 3% per quarter of the quarter’s\nopening balance. \n\nCash Float \n At the beginning of the contract, OpCo starts with a cash balance of $5,000,000, provided by its\nparent companies as operating cash.  At the end of the 15 year contract, OpCo is required to return \n$5,000,000 to its parent companies. \n \nOther Considerations \n Assume that all taxes are zero.\n Assume that no interest is earned on OpCo’s positive cash account balance.\n \nRevenue Sizing Conditions \n Values for BP1 and BP2 should be set so that the forecast cash balance on 31 Dec 2030 is exactly\nzero after paying expenses, returning the cash float and paying any outstanding debt balance. \n Neither BP1 nor BP2 can be negative (one of them can, in theory, be zero though)\n \nIn addition to the two conditions above (which should be adhered to for all questions), the following \nadditional Revenue Sizing conditions apply to specific questions as indicated: \n For Questions 27 to 29, Revenue sizing is not needed.\n For Questions 30 to 31, follow the requirements given in the question.\n For Questions 32 to 35, BP1 must be an integer multiple of $500,000.\n For Questions 32 to 37, BP1 and BP2 should be sized so that the term “ADS” is minimized.\no “ADS” stands for Absolute Difference Sum and is equal to the sum over all quarters of D\no D, for any given quarter, is equal to the absolute value of:\n Revenues – Expenses – Lifecycle Costs\n\nThere is no workbook provided for this section.  You will need to create your own.\n\n\n\nQuestion 1 \nWhat are the total Labour Expenses in calendar year 2019?

Use your model to answer the case \nstudy questions. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be a quarterly model spanning 15 calendar years, from 1 January 2016 to 31\nDecember 2030. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all book entries and cashflows occur on the final day of the\nquarter. \n \nRevenues \n Revenues are based on two bid values called Base Payment 1 (“BP1”) and Base Payment 2 (“BP2”)\n BP1 and BP2 are annual amounts, expressed in real January 2016 dollars.\n Revenue payments are made every quarter.  The amount paid each quarter end date is equal to\n \nPayment each quarter = (BP1 * 0.25 * IF1) + (BP2 * 0.25 * IF2) \n IF1 and IF2 refer to Indexation Factor 1 and Indexation Factor 2 (see below).\n\nExpenses \n Expenses are categorised in four types:\no Labour, which escalates at Indexation Factor 3 (“IF3”)\no Materials, which escalates at Indexation Factor 4 (“IF4”)\no Other Expenses, which escalates at Indexation Factor 5 (“IF5”)\no Profit Margin, which is sized as a set percentage of the total of the other three expense\ncategories.  This represents a regular and required payment to OpCo’s parent companies. \n Labour Expenses per quarter are $2,500,000 * IF3\n Materials Expenses per quarter are $1,750,000 * IF4\n Other Expenses per quarter are $750,000 * IF5\n Profit Margin Expenses each quarter are 9.00% of the total of Labour, Materials and Other Expenses.\n \nLifecycle Costs \n On 31 December 2021, lifecycle costs of $10,000,000 are incurred (no further escalation needs to be\napplied to this amount). \n On 30 June 2028, lifecycle costs of $5,000,000 are incurred (no further escalation needs to be applied\nto this amount). \n Assume these amounts are fully expensed at the time they are incurred, and are not depreciated.  No\nprofit margin is earned on the Lifecycle Costs. \n \nEscalation and Indexation \n IF1 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.2% every subsequent 1 January.\n IF2 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 4.0% every subsequent 1 January.\n IF3 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 4.8% every 1 July\n IF4 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.5% every subsequent 1 January\n IF5 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.0% every 1 July\n \nDebt \n All of OpCo’s Expenses and Lifecycle Costs are paid for by cash at the end of each quarter, after\nreceiving the Revenue Payments for that quarter. \n If required, OpCo has access to a short term revolving debt facility.  Any cash shortfall after paying\nexpenses and lifecycle costs is borrowed from the facility at the end of each quarter.  Any excess cash \nremaining after paying expenses and lifecycle costs is applied towards any outstanding balance of the \ndebt facility.   \n When the facility is drawn, interest is charged each quarter at a rate of 3% per quarter of the quarter’s\nopening balance. \n\nCash Float \n At the beginning of the contract, OpCo starts with a cash balance of $5,000,000, provided by its\nparent companies as operating cash.  At the end of the 15 year contract, OpCo is required to return \n$5,000,000 to its parent companies. \n \nOther Considerations \n Assume that all taxes are zero.\n Assume that no interest is earned on OpCo’s positive cash account balance.\n \nRevenue Sizing Conditions \n Values for BP1 and BP2 should be set so that the forecast cash balance on 31 Dec 2030 is exactly\nzero after paying expenses, returning the cash float and paying any outstanding debt balance. \n Neither BP1 nor BP2 can be negative (one of them can, in theory, be zero though)\n \nIn addition to the two conditions above (which should be adhered to for all questions), the following \nadditional Revenue Sizing conditions apply to specific questions as indicated: \n For Questions 27 to 29, Revenue sizing is not needed.\n For Questions 30 to 31, follow the requirements given in the question.\n For Questions 32 to 35, BP1 must be an integer multiple of $500,000.\n For Questions 32 to 37, BP1 and BP2 should be sized so that the term “ADS” is minimized.\no “ADS” stands for Absolute Difference Sum and is equal to the sum over all quarters of D\no D, for any given quarter, is equal to the absolute value of:\n Revenues – Expenses – Lifecycle Costs\n\nThere is no workbook provided for this section.  You will need to create your own.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3 \nWhat is the total of all Expenses and Lifecycle Costs over the contract term?

The amount paid each quarter end date is equal to\n \nPayment each quarter = (BP1 * 0.25 * IF1) + (BP2 * 0.25 * IF2) \n IF1 and IF2 refer to Indexation Factor 1 and Indexation Factor 2 (see below).\n\nExpenses \n Expenses are categorised in four types:\no Labour, which escalates at Indexation Factor 3 (“IF3”)\no Materials, which escalates at Indexation Factor 4 (“IF4”)\no Other Expenses, which escalates at Indexation Factor 5 (“IF5”)\no Profit Margin, which is sized as a set percentage of the total of the other three expense\ncategories.  This represents a regular and required payment to OpCo’s parent companies. \n Labour Expenses per quarter are $2,500,000 * IF3\n Materials Expenses per quarter are $1,750,000 * IF4\n Other Expenses per quarter are $750,000 * IF5\n Profit Margin Expenses each quarter are 9.00% of the total of Labour, Materials and Other Expenses.\n \nLifecycle Costs \n On 31 December 2021, lifecycle costs of $10,000,000 are incurred (no further escalation needs to be\napplied to this amount). \n On 30 June 2028, lifecycle costs of $5,000,000 are incurred (no further escalation needs to be applied\nto this amount). \n Assume these amounts are fully expensed at the time they are incurred, and are not depreciated.  No\nprofit margin is earned on the Lifecycle Costs. \n \nEscalation and Indexation \n IF1 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.2% every subsequent 1 January.\n IF2 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 4.0% every subsequent 1 January.\n IF3 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 4.8% every 1 July\n IF4 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.5% every subsequent 1 January\n IF5 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.0% every 1 July\n \nDebt \n All of OpCo’s Expenses and Lifecycle Costs are paid for by cash at the end of each quarter, after\nreceiving the Revenue Payments for that quarter. \n If required, OpCo has access to a short term revolving debt facility.  Any cash shortfall after paying\nexpenses and lifecycle costs is borrowed from the facility at the end of each quarter.  Any excess cash \nremaining after paying expenses and lifecycle costs is applied towards any outstanding balance of the \ndebt facility.   \n When the facility is drawn, interest is charged each quarter at a rate of 3% per quarter of the quarter’s\nopening balance. \n\nCash Float \n At the beginning of the contract, OpCo starts with a cash balance of $5,000,000, provided by its\nparent companies as operating cash.  At the end of the 15 year contract, OpCo is required to return \n$5,000,000 to its parent companies. \n \nOther Considerations \n Assume that all taxes are zero.\n Assume that no interest is earned on OpCo’s positive cash account balance.\n \nRevenue Sizing Conditions \n Values for BP1 and BP2 should be set so that the forecast cash balance on 31 Dec 2030 is exactly\nzero after paying expenses, returning the cash float and paying any outstanding debt balance. \n Neither BP1 nor BP2 can be negative (one of them can, in theory, be zero though)\n \nIn addition to the two conditions above (which should be adhered to for all questions), the following \nadditional Revenue Sizing conditions apply to specific questions as indicated: \n For Questions 27 to 29, Revenue sizing is not needed.\n For Questions 30 to 31, follow the requirements given in the question.\n For Questions 32 to 35, BP1 must be an integer multiple of $500,000.\n For Questions 32 to 37, BP1 and BP2 should be sized so that the term “ADS” is minimized.\no “ADS” stands for Absolute Difference Sum and is equal to the sum over all quarters of D\no D, for any given quarter, is equal to the absolute value of:\n Revenues – Expenses – Lifecycle Costs\n\nThere is no workbook provided for this section.  You will need to create your own.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5 \nAssume that BP2 is set to be 250% of BP1, and that both values are sized so that the final cash \nbalance is zero. What is the combined value of BP1 + BP2, rounded to the nearest $10,000? \n[4 marks] \na. $23,100,000 \nb. $23,110,000 \nc. $23,120,000 \nd. $23,130,000 \ne. $23,140,000 \nf. $23,150,000

This represents a regular and required payment to OpCo’s parent companies. \n Labour Expenses per quarter are $2,500,000 * IF3\n Materials Expenses per quarter are $1,750,000 * IF4\n Other Expenses per quarter are $750,000 * IF5\n Profit Margin Expenses each quarter are 9.00% of the total of Labour, Materials and Other Expenses.\n \nLifecycle Costs \n On 31 December 2021, lifecycle costs of $10,000,000 are incurred (no further escalation needs to be\napplied to this amount). \n On 30 June 2028, lifecycle costs of $5,000,000 are incurred (no further escalation needs to be applied\nto this amount). \n Assume these amounts are fully expensed at the time they are incurred, and are not depreciated.  No\nprofit margin is earned on the Lifecycle Costs. \n \nEscalation and Indexation \n IF1 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.2% every subsequent 1 January.\n IF2 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 4.0% every subsequent 1 January.\n IF3 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 4.8% every 1 July\n IF4 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.5% every subsequent 1 January\n IF5 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.0% every 1 July\n \nDebt \n All of OpCo’s Expenses and Lifecycle Costs are paid for by cash at the end of each quarter, after\nreceiving the Revenue Payments for that quarter. \n If required, OpCo has access to a short term revolving debt facility.  Any cash shortfall after paying\nexpenses and lifecycle costs is borrowed from the facility at the end of each quarter.  Any excess cash \nremaining after paying expenses and lifecycle costs is applied towards any outstanding balance of the \ndebt facility.   \n When the facility is drawn, interest is charged each quarter at a rate of 3% per quarter of the quarter’s\nopening balance. \n\nCash Float \n At the beginning of the contract, OpCo starts with a cash balance of $5,000,000, provided by its\nparent companies as operating cash.  At the end of the 15 year contract, OpCo is required to return \n$5,000,000 to its parent companies. \n \nOther Considerations \n Assume that all taxes are zero.\n Assume that no interest is earned on OpCo’s positive cash account balance.\n \nRevenue Sizing Conditions \n Values for BP1 and BP2 should be set so that the forecast cash balance on 31 Dec 2030 is exactly\nzero after paying expenses, returning the cash float and paying any outstanding debt balance. \n Neither BP1 nor BP2 can be negative (one of them can, in theory, be zero though)\n \nIn addition to the two conditions above (which should be adhered to for all questions), the following \nadditional Revenue Sizing conditions apply to specific questions as indicated: \n For Questions 27 to 29, Revenue sizing is not needed.\n For Questions 30 to 31, follow the requirements given in the question.\n For Questions 32 to 35, BP1 must be an integer multiple of $500,000.\n For Questions 32 to 37, BP1 and BP2 should be sized so that the term “ADS” is minimized.\no “ADS” stands for Absolute Difference Sum and is equal to the sum over all quarters of D\no D, for any given quarter, is equal to the absolute value of:\n Revenues – Expenses – Lifecycle Costs\n\nThere is no workbook provided for this section.  You will need to create your own.\n\n\n\nQuestion 7 \nUsing the correct values for BP1 and BP2 solved for in Question 6, what is the solved minimum\nvalue of ADS?

This represents a regular and required payment to OpCo’s parent companies. \n Labour Expenses per quarter are $2,500,000 * IF3\n Materials Expenses per quarter are $1,750,000 * IF4\n Other Expenses per quarter are $750,000 * IF5\n Profit Margin Expenses each quarter are 9.00% of the total of Labour, Materials and Other Expenses.\n \nLifecycle Costs \n On 31 December 2021, lifecycle costs of $10,000,000 are incurred (no further escalation needs to be\napplied to this amount). \n On 30 June 2028, lifecycle costs of $5,000,000 are incurred (no further escalation needs to be applied\nto this amount). \n Assume these amounts are fully expensed at the time they are incurred, and are not depreciated.  No\nprofit margin is earned on the Lifecycle Costs. \n \nEscalation and Indexation \n IF1 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.2% every subsequent 1 January.\n IF2 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 4.0% every subsequent 1 January.\n IF3 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 4.8% every 1 July\n IF4 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.5% every subsequent 1 January\n IF5 is equal to 1.00 at 1 Jan 2016, and increases by 2.0% every 1 July\n \nDebt \n All of OpCo’s Expenses and Lifecycle Costs are paid for by cash at the end of each quarter, after\nreceiving the Revenue Payments for that quarter. \n If required, OpCo has access to a short term revolving debt facility.  Any cash shortfall after paying\nexpenses and lifecycle costs is borrowed from the facility at the end of each quarter.  Any excess cash \nremaining after paying expenses and lifecycle costs is applied towards any outstanding balance of the \ndebt facility.   \n When the facility is drawn, interest is charged each quarter at a rate of 3% per quarter of the quarter’s\nopening balance. \n\nCash Float \n At the beginning of the contract, OpCo starts with a cash balance of $5,000,000, provided by its\nparent companies as operating cash.  At the end of the 15 year contract, OpCo is required to return \n$5,000,000 to its parent companies. \n \nOther Considerations \n Assume that all taxes are zero.\n Assume that no interest is earned on OpCo’s positive cash account balance.\n \nRevenue Sizing Conditions \n Values for BP1 and BP2 should be set so that the forecast cash balance on 31 Dec 2030 is exactly\nzero after paying expenses, returning the cash float and paying any outstanding debt balance. \n Neither BP1 nor BP2 can be negative (one of them can, in theory, be zero though)\n \nIn addition to the two conditions above (which should be adhered to for all questions), the following \nadditional Revenue Sizing conditions apply to specific questions as indicated: \n For Questions 27 to 29, Revenue sizing is not needed.\n For Questions 30 to 31, follow the requirements given in the question.\n For Questions 32 to 35, BP1 must be an integer multiple of $500,000.\n For Questions 32 to 37, BP1 and BP2 should be sized so that the term “ADS” is minimized.\no “ADS” stands for Absolute Difference Sum and is equal to the sum over all quarters of D\no D, for any given quarter, is equal to the absolute value of:\n Revenues – Expenses – Lifecycle Costs\n\nThere is no workbook provided for this section.  You will need to create your own.\n\n\n\nQuestion 9 \nUsing the correct values for BP1 and BP2 solved for in Q uestion 6 , calculate the ratio of BP2 : BP1 \nand express it as a percentage to 2 decimal places . What are the 2 decimal places to the right of \nthe decimal point? [4 marks] \na. 07 \nb. 12 \nc. 17 \nd. 22 \ne. 27 \nf. 32 \n

Any excess cash \nremaining after paying expenses and lifecycle costs is applied towards any outstanding balance of the \ndebt facility.   \n When the facility is drawn, interest is charged each quarter at a rate of 3% per quarter of the quarter’s\nopening balance. \n\nCash Float \n At the beginning of the contract, OpCo starts with a cash balance of $5,000,000, provided by its\nparent companies as operating cash.  At the end of the 15 year contract, OpCo is required to return \n$5,000,000 to its parent companies. \n \nOther Considerations \n Assume that all taxes are zero.\n Assume that no interest is earned on OpCo’s positive cash account balance.\n \nRevenue Sizing Conditions \n Values for BP1 and BP2 should be set so that the forecast cash balance on 31 Dec 2030 is exactly\nzero after paying expenses, returning the cash float and paying any outstanding debt balance. \n Neither BP1 nor BP2 can be negative (one of them can, in theory, be zero though)\n \nIn addition to the two conditions above (which should be adhered to for all questions), the following \nadditional Revenue Sizing conditions apply to specific questions as indicated: \n For Questions 27 to 29, Revenue sizing is not needed.\n For Questions 30 to 31, follow the requirements given in the question.\n For Questions 32 to 35, BP1 must be an integer multiple of $500,000.\n For Questions 32 to 37, BP1 and BP2 should be sized so that the term “ADS” is minimized.\no “ADS” stands for Absolute Difference Sum and is equal to the sum over all quarters of D\no D, for any given quarter, is equal to the absolute value of:\n Revenues – Expenses – Lifecycle Costs\n\nThere is no workbook provided for this section.  You will need to create your own.\n\n\n\nQuestion 11 \nThis question uses the same assumptions and conditions as the previous question. \nRound BP1 to the nearest whole dollar, and you will have a number that is either 6, 7 or 8 digits\nlong. What is the sum of these digits? [6 marks]\na. 27\nb. 30\nc. 33\nd. 36\ne. 39\nf. 42

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.  Sizing of \ndistributions is only constrained by cash available - not by book profits. \n \nOther Considerations \n Assume that all taxes are zero.\n Assume that no interest is earned / paid on Macrohard’s positive / negative cash account balance.\n\nQuestion 11 \nTo the nearest thousand dollars, what is the value of Net Cash Flow (before distributions) in year \n4?

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.

The help \nassess your skills, the firm asks you to complete what it calls its “Bread and Butter” test – an example of \nthe fundamental model building work that its analysts need to do day in and day out.   You will need to \nbuild a dynamic financial model showing the forecast performance of a fictitious technology company they \nare looking to purchase, Macrohard. \nThe firm would like a “3-way integrated financial model” – that is a model which includes the 3 standard \nfinancial statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) and allows updates to \nassumption values to correctly flow through to all of the financial statements.  In order to model the \nstatements correctly you will also need to do some simple modelling of a debt facility and depreciation \ntranches.  The final output of the model will be the distributions to equity investors and the IRR achieved \nby the equity investors. \nInformation is provided below regarding the assumed forecast performance of Macrohard as well as \ngeneral model assumptions.  Use your model to answer the case study questions. \nTo assist you, a workbook has been provided that includes some of the assumptions you will need, plus a \ntemplate for the Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Statement.  No template is provided for the Cash \nFlow Statement. \n \nASSUMPTIONS \nGeneral Model Assumptions \n Your model should be an annual model showing 10 calendar year time periods, plus the initial “Day 0”\nBalance Sheet. \n The equity investment date (“Day 0”) is 31 December 2015.\n The first period (“Year 1”) covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, and the final model period\n(“Year 10”) covers 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. Any activity after year 10 is ignored for \nanalysis purposes and is not modelled. \n Unless otherwise specified, assume all cashflows occur on the final day of the period.\n\nDay 0 Transactions / Initial Investment \n $30,000,000 equity is invested on Day 0.\n $20,000,000 debt is borrowed on Day 0.\n The Balance Sheet Assets on Day 0 are:\n    o $3,000,000 cash\n    o $3,000,000 accounts receivable\n    o $4,000,000 inventory\n    o $40,000,000 Property Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)\n \nRevenues \n Year 1 Sales are $25,000,000.\n Sales grow annually by the minimum of either (i) $3,000,000 or (ii) 8% of the previous year’s sales.\n \nCost of Goods Sold \n Cost of Goods Sold equals 60% of sales\n \nExpenses \n Year 1 Expenses are $3,000,000\n Expenses grow annually by 7% of the previous year’s expenses.\n \nCapital Expenditure \n On the final day of Year 4, additional PPE is purchased for $10,000,000.\n This new purchase is 90% funded by an equity injection on the same day, with the remainder funded\nby cash on hand. \n \nDepreciation \n The original $40,000,000 PPE (purchased on Day 0) depreciates over 10 years in a straight line\nmethod ($4,000,000 per year). \n The new PPE (purchased at the end of year 4) depreciates over 5 years in a straight line method.\n \nDebt \n Interest is charged on the outstanding debt at a rate of 6.50% per annum.  Interest is paid at the end\nof each year. \n Principal repayments (i.e. not counting interest) are $2,500,000 per year until the debt is repaid.\nRepayments are made at the end of each year, immediately after interest payments are made.\n \nPayment Terms / Working Capital \n Inventory at the end of each year is equal to 30% of Cost of Goods Sold\n Accounts Receivable at the end of each year are 10% of Sales\n Accounts Payable at the end of each year are 12% of Cost of Goods Sold plus 15% of Expenses\n \nDistributions to Equity \n At the end of each of year, any amount above $4,000,000 in the cash account after all other\nconsiderations are dealt with is distributed to equity investors.  If there is less than or equal to \n$4,000,000 in the cash account prior to distributions, no distribution is made that year.  Sizing of \ndistributions is only constrained by cash available - not by book profits. \n \nOther Considerations \n Assume that all taxes are zero.\n Assume that no interest is earned / paid on Macrohard’s positive / negative cash account balance.\n\nQuestion 15 \nAssume that Sales grow by a set percentage year on year, rather than as the minimum of a fixed \namount or a set percentage.

You have identified \nsix carriers in the local market, each offering a single mobile phone plan. Each plan has an included \nnumber of minutes to make phone calls, an included number of text messages and an included allocation \nof data. Each plan also has rates that apply once the included allocations have been fully used. \nYou will need to model each of these mobile plans over a 36 month period to help determine which will be \nthe best mobile plan for your needs. The evaluation period will be from 1 January 2016 until \n31 December 2018. \nMOBILE PLANS \nThe key details for each plan are summarised in the table below: \n\nCarrier        Run     Swim   Bike    Jump    Kayak   Skip\nCost per month ($)       60      80      80      75      60      10\nIncluded minutes         400     180     Unlimited Unlimited  320     150\nIncluded text messages   Unlimited   1,200   750     500     Unlimited   3,000\nDo text messages carry forward to the next month?  NA      Yes     No      Yes     NA      No\nIncluded data        1,250 MB    Unlimited   2,000 MB    1,500 MB    3,000 MB    1,250 MB\nAdditional minutes ($ per minute) 0.10    0.69    NA      0.99    0.59\nAdditional text messages ($ per text message)   NA      0.04    0.10    0.05    NA      0.06\nAdditional data pack ($ per pack) 10      NA      35      20      50      45\nAdditional data (MB per pack)     50      NA      100     200     50      300\n\nAll costs and values are monthly unless stated otherwise. All contracts have no minimum length and no \nbreak costs for cancellation. \nAny unused minutes carry forward and can be used in future months. Carried forward minutes do not \nexpire. Where noted, unused text messages also carry forward to be used in future months.  Any carried \nforward text messages also do not expire. Data allowances do not carry forward. Additional data is \ncharged in packs, with a fixed cost for every additional pack of data required. You cannot purchase a \npartial data pack. \n\nJOINING INCENTIVES \nEach plan has an incentive on offer to encourage new customers to sign up. The incentives are detailed \nbelow. \nThese incentives are only used to answers questions 49 to 52. Do not include them when \ncompleting questions 43 to 48. \n\nCarrier  Incentive\nRun      First two months of the plan, the base cost is free of charge.\nSwim     First six months have a 50% discount on the base cost of the plan.\nBike     First three months have a 60% discount on the total cost of the plan (base cost and any additional usage charges).\nJump     An extra 1,000MB of data included for each of the first 9 months.\nKayak    Double the allocation of included minutes for the first 4 months.\nSkip     Double the allocation of included data for the first 3 months.\n\n\nYOUR USAGE \nYou expect: \n your standard monthly usage to be 300 minutes, 1,000 text messages and 2,000MB of data.\n to use 1.5x your standard amount of minutes, text messages and data every June and July and 2x\nyour standard monthly usage of minutes, text messages and data every December.  \n your standard monthly usage to increase by 5% per annum (effective from 1 January each year).\nFor the purpose of this analysis, partial minutes, text messages and MB of data are allowed \n(i.e., do not round this annual increase).

You have identified \nsix carriers in the local market, each offering a single mobile phone plan. Each plan has an included \nnumber of minutes to make phone calls, an included number of text messages and an included allocation \nof data. Each plan also has rates that apply once the included allocations have been fully used. \nYou will need to model each of these mobile plans over a 36 month period to help determine which will be \nthe best mobile plan for your needs. The evaluation period will be from 1 January 2016 until \n31 December 2018. \nMOBILE PLANS \nThe key details for each plan are summarised in the table below: \n\nCarrier        Run     Swim   Bike    Jump    Kayak   Skip\nCost per month ($)       60      80      80      75      60      10\nIncluded minutes         400     180     Unlimited Unlimited  320     150\nIncluded text messages   Unlimited   1,200   750     500     Unlimited   3,000\nDo text messages carry forward to the next month?  NA      Yes     No      Yes     NA      No\nIncluded data        1,250 MB    Unlimited   2,000 MB    1,500 MB    3,000 MB    1,250 MB\nAdditional minutes ($ per minute) 0.10    0.69    NA      0.99    0.59\nAdditional text messages ($ per text message)   NA      0.04    0.10    0.05    NA      0.06\nAdditional data pack ($ per pack) 10      NA      35      20      50      45\nAdditional data (MB per pack)     50      NA      100     200     50      300\n\nAll costs and values are monthly unless stated otherwise. All contracts have no minimum length and no \nbreak costs for cancellation. \nAny unused minutes carry forward and can be used in future months. Carried forward minutes do not \nexpire. Where noted, unused text messages also carry forward to be used in future months.  Any carried \nforward text messages also do not expire. Data allowances do not carry forward. Additional data is \ncharged in packs, with a fixed cost for every additional pack of data required. You cannot purchase a \npartial data pack. \n\nJOINING INCENTIVES \nEach plan has an incentive on offer to encourage new customers to sign up. The incentives are detailed \nbelow. \nThese incentives are only used to answers questions 49 to 52. Do not include them when \ncompleting questions 43 to 48. \n\nCarrier  Incentive\nRun      First two months of the plan, the base cost is free of charge.\nSwim     First six months have a 50% discount on the base cost of the plan.\nBike     First three months have a 60% discount on the total cost of the plan (base cost and any additional usage charges).\nJump     An extra 1,000MB of data included for each of the first 9 months.\nKayak    Double the allocation of included minutes for the first 4 months.\nSkip     Double the allocation of included data for the first 3 months.\n\n\nYOUR USAGE \nYou expect: \n your standard monthly usage to be 300 minutes, 1,000 text messages and 2,000MB of data.\n to use 1.5x your standard amount of minutes, text messages and data every June and July and 2x\nyour standard monthly usage of minutes, text messages and data every December.  \n your standard monthly usage to increase by 5% per annum (effective from 1 January each year).\nFor the purpose of this analysis, partial minutes, text messages and MB of data are allowed \n(i.e., do not round this annual increase).

You have identified \nsix carriers in the local market, each offering a single mobile phone plan. Each plan has an included \nnumber of minutes to make phone calls, an included number of text messages and an included allocation \nof data. Each plan also has rates that apply once the included allocations have been fully used. \nYou will need to model each of these mobile plans over a 36 month period to help determine which will be \nthe best mobile plan for your needs. The evaluation period will be from 1 January 2016 until \n31 December 2018. \nMOBILE PLANS \nThe key details for each plan are summarised in the table below: \n\nCarrier        Run     Swim   Bike    Jump    Kayak   Skip\nCost per month ($)       60      80      80      75      60      10\nIncluded minutes         400     180     Unlimited Unlimited  320     150\nIncluded text messages   Unlimited   1,200   750     500     Unlimited   3,000\nDo text messages carry forward to the next month?  NA      Yes     No      Yes     NA      No\nIncluded data        1,250 MB    Unlimited   2,000 MB    1,500 MB    3,000 MB    1,250 MB\nAdditional minutes ($ per minute) 0.10    0.69    NA      0.99    0.59\nAdditional text messages ($ per text message)   NA      0.04    0.10    0.05    NA      0.06\nAdditional data pack ($ per pack) 10      NA      35      20      50      45\nAdditional data (MB per pack)     50      NA      100     200     50      300\n\nAll costs and values are monthly unless stated otherwise. All contracts have no minimum length and no \nbreak costs for cancellation. \nAny unused minutes carry forward and can be used in future months. Carried forward minutes do not \nexpire. Where noted, unused text messages also carry forward to be used in future months.  Any carried \nforward text messages also do not expire. Data allowances do not carry forward. Additional data is \ncharged in packs, with a fixed cost for every additional pack of data required. You cannot purchase a \npartial data pack. \n\nJOINING INCENTIVES \nEach plan has an incentive on offer to encourage new customers to sign up. The incentives are detailed \nbelow. \nThese incentives are only used to answers questions 49 to 52. Do not include them when \ncompleting questions 43 to 48. \n\nCarrier  Incentive\nRun      First two months of the plan, the base cost is free of charge.\nSwim     First six months have a 50% discount on the base cost of the plan.\nBike     First three months have a 60% discount on the total cost of the plan (base cost and any additional usage charges).\nJump     An extra 1,000MB of data included for each of the first 9 months.\nKayak    Double the allocation of included minutes for the first 4 months.\nSkip     Double the allocation of included data for the first 3 months.\n\n\nYOUR USAGE \nYou expect: \n your standard monthly usage to be 300 minutes, 1,000 text messages and 2,000MB of data.\n to use 1.5x your standard amount of minutes, text messages and data every June and July and 2x\nyour standard monthly usage of minutes, text messages and data every December.  \n your standard monthly usage to increase by 5% per annum (effective from 1 January each year).\nFor the purpose of this analysis, partial minutes, text messages and MB of data are allowed \n(i.e., do not round this annual increase).

You have identified \nsix carriers in the local market, each offering a single mobile phone plan. Each plan has an included \nnumber of minutes to make phone calls, an included number of text messages and an included allocation \nof data. Each plan also has rates that apply once the included allocations have been fully used. \nYou will need to model each of these mobile plans over a 36 month period to help determine which will be \nthe best mobile plan for your needs. The evaluation period will be from 1 January 2016 until \n31 December 2018. \nMOBILE PLANS \nThe key details for each plan are summarised in the table below: \n\nCarrier        Run     Swim   Bike    Jump    Kayak   Skip\nCost per month ($)       60      80      80      75      60      10\nIncluded minutes         400     180     Unlimited Unlimited  320     150\nIncluded text messages   Unlimited   1,200   750     500     Unlimited   3,000\nDo text messages carry forward to the next month?  NA      Yes     No      Yes     NA      No\nIncluded data        1,250 MB    Unlimited   2,000 MB    1,500 MB    3,000 MB    1,250 MB\nAdditional minutes ($ per minute) 0.10    0.69    NA      0.99    0.59\nAdditional text messages ($ per text message)   NA      0.04    0.10    0.05    NA      0.06\nAdditional data pack ($ per pack) 10      NA      35      20      50      45\nAdditional data (MB per pack)     50      NA      100     200     50      300\n\nAll costs and values are monthly unless stated otherwise. All contracts have no minimum length and no \nbreak costs for cancellation. \nAny unused minutes carry forward and can be used in future months. Carried forward minutes do not \nexpire. Where noted, unused text messages also carry forward to be used in future months.  Any carried \nforward text messages also do not expire. Data allowances do not carry forward. Additional data is \ncharged in packs, with a fixed cost for every additional pack of data required. You cannot purchase a \npartial data pack. \n\nJOINING INCENTIVES \nEach plan has an incentive on offer to encourage new customers to sign up. The incentives are detailed \nbelow. \nThese incentives are only used to answers questions 49 to 52. Do not include them when \ncompleting questions 43 to 48. \n\nCarrier  Incentive\nRun      First two months of the plan, the base cost is free of charge.\nSwim     First six months have a 50% discount on the base cost of the plan.\nBike     First three months have a 60% discount on the total cost of the plan (base cost and any additional usage charges).\nJump     An extra 1,000MB of data included for each of the first 9 months.\nKayak    Double the allocation of included minutes for the first 4 months.\nSkip     Double the allocation of included data for the first 3 months.\n\n\nYOUR USAGE \nYou expect: \n your standard monthly usage to be 300 minutes, 1,000 text messages and 2,000MB of data.\n to use 1.5x your standard amount of minutes, text messages and data every June and July and 2x\nyour standard monthly usage of minutes, text messages and data every December.  \n your standard monthly usage to increase by 5% per annum (effective from 1 January each year).\nFor the purpose of this analysis, partial minutes, text messages and MB of data are allowed \n(i.e., do not round this annual increase).

You have identified \nsix carriers in the local market, each offering a single mobile phone plan. Each plan has an included \nnumber of minutes to make phone calls, an included number of text messages and an included allocation \nof data. Each plan also has rates that apply once the included allocations have been fully used. \nYou will need to model each of these mobile plans over a 36 month period to help determine which will be \nthe best mobile plan for your needs. The evaluation period will be from 1 January 2016 until \n31 December 2018. \nMOBILE PLANS \nThe key details for each plan are summarised in the table below: \n\nCarrier        Run     Swim   Bike    Jump    Kayak   Skip\nCost per month ($)       60      80      80      75      60      10\nIncluded minutes         400     180     Unlimited Unlimited  320     150\nIncluded text messages   Unlimited   1,200   750     500     Unlimited   3,000\nDo text messages carry forward to the next month?  NA      Yes     No      Yes     NA      No\nIncluded data        1,250 MB    Unlimited   2,000 MB    1,500 MB    3,000 MB    1,250 MB\nAdditional minutes ($ per minute) 0.10    0.69    NA      0.99    0.59\nAdditional text messages ($ per text message)   NA      0.04    0.10    0.05    NA      0.06\nAdditional data pack ($ per pack) 10      NA      35      20      50      45\nAdditional data (MB per pack)     50      NA      100     200     50      300\n\nAll costs and values are monthly unless stated otherwise. All contracts have no minimum length and no \nbreak costs for cancellation. \nAny unused minutes carry forward and can be used in future months. Carried forward minutes do not \nexpire. Where noted, unused text messages also carry forward to be used in future months.  Any carried \nforward text messages also do not expire. Data allowances do not carry forward. Additional data is \ncharged in packs, with a fixed cost for every additional pack of data required. You cannot purchase a \npartial data pack. \n\nJOINING INCENTIVES \nEach plan has an incentive on offer to encourage new customers to sign up. The incentives are detailed \nbelow. \nThese incentives are only used to answers questions 49 to 52. Do not include them when \ncompleting questions 43 to 48. \n\nCarrier  Incentive\nRun      First two months of the plan, the base cost is free of charge.\nSwim     First six months have a 50% discount on the base cost of the plan.\nBike     First three months have a 60% discount on the total cost of the plan (base cost and any additional usage charges).\nJump     An extra 1,000MB of data included for each of the first 9 months.\nKayak    Double the allocation of included minutes for the first 4 months.\nSkip     Double the allocation of included data for the first 3 months.\n\n\nYOUR USAGE \nYou expect: \n your standard monthly usage to be 300 minutes, 1,000 text messages and 2,000MB of data.\n to use 1.5x your standard amount of minutes, text messages and data every June and July and 2x\nyour standard monthly usage of minutes, text messages and data every December.  \n your standard monthly usage to increase by 5% per annum (effective from 1 January each year).\nFor the purpose of this analysis, partial minutes, text messages and MB of data are allowed \n(i.e., do not round this annual increase).

You have identified \nsix carriers in the local market, each offering a single mobile phone plan. Each plan has an included \nnumber of minutes to make phone calls, an included number of text messages and an included allocation \nof data. Each plan also has rates that apply once the included allocations have been fully used. \nYou will need to model each of these mobile plans over a 36 month period to help determine which will be \nthe best mobile plan for your needs. The evaluation period will be from 1 January 2016 until \n31 December 2018. \nMOBILE PLANS \nThe key details for each plan are summarised in the table below: \n\nCarrier        Run     Swim   Bike    Jump    Kayak   Skip\nCost per month ($)       60      80      80      75      60      10\nIncluded minutes         400     180     Unlimited Unlimited  320     150\nIncluded text messages   Unlimited   1,200   750     500     Unlimited   3,000\nDo text messages carry forward to the next month?  NA      Yes     No      Yes     NA      No\nIncluded data        1,250 MB    Unlimited   2,000 MB    1,500 MB    3,000 MB    1,250 MB\nAdditional minutes ($ per minute) 0.10    0.69    NA      0.99    0.59\nAdditional text messages ($ per text message)   NA      0.04    0.10    0.05    NA      0.06\nAdditional data pack ($ per pack) 10      NA      35      20      50      45\nAdditional data (MB per pack)     50      NA      100     200     50      300\n\nAll costs and values are monthly unless stated otherwise. All contracts have no minimum length and no \nbreak costs for cancellation. \nAny unused minutes carry forward and can be used in future months. Carried forward minutes do not \nexpire. Where noted, unused text messages also carry forward to be used in future months.  Any carried \nforward text messages also do not expire. Data allowances do not carry forward. Additional data is \ncharged in packs, with a fixed cost for every additional pack of data required. You cannot purchase a \npartial data pack. \n\nJOINING INCENTIVES \nEach plan has an incentive on offer to encourage new customers to sign up. The incentives are detailed \nbelow. \nThese incentives are only used to answers questions 49 to 52. Do not include them when \ncompleting questions 43 to 48. \n\nCarrier  Incentive\nRun      First two months of the plan, the base cost is free of charge.\nSwim     First six months have a 50% discount on the base cost of the plan.\nBike     First three months have a 60% discount on the total cost of the plan (base cost and any additional usage charges).\nJump     An extra 1,000MB of data included for each of the first 9 months.\nKayak    Double the allocation of included minutes for the first 4 months.\nSkip     Double the allocation of included data for the first 3 months.\n\n\nYOUR USAGE \nYou expect: \n your standard monthly usage to be 300 minutes, 1,000 text messages and 2,000MB of data.\n to use 1.5x your standard amount of minutes, text messages and data every June and July and 2x\nyour standard monthly usage of minutes, text messages and data every December.  \n your standard monthly usage to increase by 5% per annum (effective from 1 January each year).\nFor the purpose of this analysis, partial minutes, text messages and MB of data are allowed \n(i.e., do not round this annual increase). Assume that partial additional minutes and partial \nadditional text messages can be purchased at a pro-rata price. \n\nQuestion 6\nWhat length of contract (beginning in January 2016) would give the same total cost over the\ncontract length between the carriers Bike and Jump?

You have identified \nsix carriers in the local market, each offering a single mobile phone plan. Each plan has an included \nnumber of minutes to make phone calls, an included number of text messages and an included allocation \nof data. Each plan also has rates that apply once the included allocations have been fully used. \nYou will need to model each of these mobile plans over a 36 month period to help determine which will be \nthe best mobile plan for your needs. The evaluation period will be from 1 January 2016 until \n31 December 2018. \nMOBILE PLANS \nThe key details for each plan are summarised in the table below: \n\nCarrier        Run     Swim   Bike    Jump    Kayak   Skip\nCost per month ($)       60      80      80      75      60      10\nIncluded minutes         400     180     Unlimited Unlimited  320     150\nIncluded text messages   Unlimited   1,200   750     500     Unlimited   3,000\nDo text messages carry forward to the next month?  NA      Yes     No      Yes     NA      No\nIncluded data        1,250 MB    Unlimited   2,000 MB    1,500 MB    3,000 MB    1,250 MB\nAdditional minutes ($ per minute) 0.10    0.69    NA      0.99    0.59\nAdditional text messages ($ per text message)   NA      0.04    0.10    0.05    NA      0.06\nAdditional data pack ($ per pack) 10      NA      35      20      50      45\nAdditional data (MB per pack)     50      NA      100     200     50      300\n\nAll costs and values are monthly unless stated otherwise. All contracts have no minimum length and no \nbreak costs for cancellation. \nAny unused minutes carry forward and can be used in future months. Carried forward minutes do not \nexpire. Where noted, unused text messages also carry forward to be used in future months.  Any carried \nforward text messages also do not expire. Data allowances do not carry forward. Additional data is \ncharged in packs, with a fixed cost for every additional pack of data required. You cannot purchase a \npartial data pack. \n\nJOINING INCENTIVES \nEach plan has an incentive on offer to encourage new customers to sign up. The incentives are detailed \nbelow. \nThese incentives are only used to answers questions 49 to 52. Do not include them when \ncompleting questions 43 to 48. \n\nCarrier  Incentive\nRun      First two months of the plan, the base cost is free of charge.\nSwim     First six months have a 50% discount on the base cost of the plan.\nBike     First three months have a 60% discount on the total cost of the plan (base cost and any additional usage charges).\nJump     An extra 1,000MB of data included for each of the first 9 months.\nKayak    Double the allocation of included minutes for the first 4 months.\nSkip     Double the allocation of included data for the first 3 months.\n\n\nYOUR USAGE \nYou expect: \n your standard monthly usage to be 300 minutes, 1,000 text messages and 2,000MB of data.\n to use 1.5x your standard amount of minutes, text messages and data every June and July and 2x\nyour standard monthly usage of minutes, text messages and data every December.  \n your standard monthly usage to increase by 5% per annum (effective from 1 January each year).\nFor the purpose of this analysis, partial minutes, text messages and MB of data are allowed \n(i.e., do not round this annual increase).

You have identified \nsix carriers in the local market, each offering a single mobile phone plan. Each plan has an included \nnumber of minutes to make phone calls, an included number of text messages and an included allocation \nof data. Each plan also has rates that apply once the included allocations have been fully used. \nYou will need to model each of these mobile plans over a 36 month period to help determine which will be \nthe best mobile plan for your needs. The evaluation period will be from 1 January 2016 until \n31 December 2018. \nMOBILE PLANS \nThe key details for each plan are summarised in the table below: \n\nCarrier        Run     Swim   Bike    Jump    Kayak   Skip\nCost per month ($)       60      80      80      75      60      10\nIncluded minutes         400     180     Unlimited Unlimited  320     150\nIncluded text messages   Unlimited   1,200   750     500     Unlimited   3,000\nDo text messages carry forward to the next month?  NA      Yes     No      Yes     NA      No\nIncluded data        1,250 MB    Unlimited   2,000 MB    1,500 MB    3,000 MB    1,250 MB\nAdditional minutes ($ per minute) 0.10    0.69    NA      0.99    0.59\nAdditional text messages ($ per text message)   NA      0.04    0.10    0.05    NA      0.06\nAdditional data pack ($ per pack) 10      NA      35      20      50      45\nAdditional data (MB per pack)     50      NA      100     200     50      300\n\nAll costs and values are monthly unless stated otherwise. All contracts have no minimum length and no \nbreak costs for cancellation. \nAny unused minutes carry forward and can be used in future months. Carried forward minutes do not \nexpire. Where noted, unused text messages also carry forward to be used in future months.  Any carried \nforward text messages also do not expire. Data allowances do not carry forward. Additional data is \ncharged in packs, with a fixed cost for every additional pack of data required. You cannot purchase a \npartial data pack. \n\nJOINING INCENTIVES \nEach plan has an incentive on offer to encourage new customers to sign up. The incentives are detailed \nbelow. \nThese incentives are only used to answers questions 49 to 52. Do not include them when \ncompleting questions 43 to 48. \n\nCarrier  Incentive\nRun      First two months of the plan, the base cost is free of charge.\nSwim     First six months have a 50% discount on the base cost of the plan.\nBike     First three months have a 60% discount on the total cost of the plan (base cost and any additional usage charges).\nJump     An extra 1,000MB of data included for each of the first 9 months.\nKayak    Double the allocation of included minutes for the first 4 months.\nSkip     Double the allocation of included data for the first 3 months.\n\n\nYOUR USAGE \nYou expect: \n your standard monthly usage to be 300 minutes, 1,000 text messages and 2,000MB of data.\n to use 1.5x your standard amount of minutes, text messages and data every June and July and 2x\nyour standard monthly usage of minutes, text messages and data every December.  \n your standard monthly usage to increase by 5% per annum (effective from 1 January each year).\nFor the purpose of this analysis, partial minutes, text messages and MB of data are allowed \n(i.e., do not round this annual increase).

You have identified \nsix carriers in the local market, each offering a single mobile phone plan. Each plan has an included \nnumber of minutes to make phone calls, an included number of text messages and an included allocation \nof data. Each plan also has rates that apply once the included allocations have been fully used. \nYou will need to model each of these mobile plans over a 36 month period to help determine which will be \nthe best mobile plan for your needs. The evaluation period will be from 1 January 2016 until \n31 December 2018. \nMOBILE PLANS \nThe key details for each plan are summarised in the table below: \n\nCarrier        Run     Swim   Bike    Jump    Kayak   Skip\nCost per month ($)       60      80      80      75      60      10\nIncluded minutes         400     180     Unlimited Unlimited  320     150\nIncluded text messages   Unlimited   1,200   750     500     Unlimited   3,000\nDo text messages carry forward to the next month?  NA      Yes     No      Yes     NA      No\nIncluded data        1,250 MB    Unlimited   2,000 MB    1,500 MB    3,000 MB    1,250 MB\nAdditional minutes ($ per minute) 0.10    0.69    NA      0.99    0.59\nAdditional text messages ($ per text message)   NA      0.04    0.10    0.05    NA      0.06\nAdditional data pack ($ per pack) 10      NA      35      20      50      45\nAdditional data (MB per pack)     50      NA      100     200     50      300\n\nAll costs and values are monthly unless stated otherwise. All contracts have no minimum length and no \nbreak costs for cancellation. \nAny unused minutes carry forward and can be used in future months. Carried forward minutes do not \nexpire. Where noted, unused text messages also carry forward to be used in future months.  Any carried \nforward text messages also do not expire. Data allowances do not carry forward. Additional data is \ncharged in packs, with a fixed cost for every additional pack of data required. You cannot purchase a \npartial data pack. \n\nJOINING INCENTIVES \nEach plan has an incentive on offer to encourage new customers to sign up. The incentives are detailed \nbelow. \nThese incentives are only used to answers questions 49 to 52. Do not include them when \ncompleting questions 43 to 48. \n\nCarrier  Incentive\nRun      First two months of the plan, the base cost is free of charge.\nSwim     First six months have a 50% discount on the base cost of the plan.\nBike     First three months have a 60% discount on the total cost of the plan (base cost and any additional usage charges).\nJump     An extra 1,000MB of data included for each of the first 9 months.\nKayak    Double the allocation of included minutes for the first 4 months.\nSkip     Double the allocation of included data for the first 3 months.\n\n\nYOUR USAGE \nYou expect: \n your standard monthly usage to be 300 minutes, 1,000 text messages and 2,000MB of data.\n to use 1.5x your standard amount of minutes, text messages and data every June and July and 2x\nyour standard monthly usage of minutes, text messages and data every December.  \n your standard monthly usage to increase by 5% per annum (effective from 1 January each year).\nFor the purpose of this analysis, partial minutes, text messages and MB of data are allowed \n(i.e., do not round this annual increase).

You have identified \nsix carriers in the local market, each offering a single mobile phone plan. Each plan has an included \nnumber of minutes to make phone calls, an included number of text messages and an included allocation \nof data. Each plan also has rates that apply once the included allocations have been fully used. \nYou will need to model each of these mobile plans over a 36 month period to help determine which will be \nthe best mobile plan for your needs. The evaluation period will be from 1 January 2016 until \n31 December 2018. \nMOBILE PLANS \nThe key details for each plan are summarised in the table below: \n\nCarrier        Run     Swim   Bike    Jump    Kayak   Skip\nCost per month ($)       60      80      80      75      60      10\nIncluded minutes         400     180     Unlimited Unlimited  320     150\nIncluded text messages   Unlimited   1,200   750     500     Unlimited   3,000\nDo text messages carry forward to the next month?  NA      Yes     No      Yes     NA      No\nIncluded data        1,250 MB    Unlimited   2,000 MB    1,500 MB    3,000 MB    1,250 MB\nAdditional minutes ($ per minute) 0.10    0.69    NA      0.99    0.59\nAdditional text messages ($ per text message)   NA      0.04    0.10    0.05    NA      0.06\nAdditional data pack ($ per pack) 10      NA      35      20      50      45\nAdditional data (MB per pack)     50      NA      100     200     50      300\n\nAll costs and values are monthly unless stated otherwise. All contracts have no minimum length and no \nbreak costs for cancellation. \nAny unused minutes carry forward and can be used in future months. Carried forward minutes do not \nexpire. Where noted, unused text messages also carry forward to be used in future months.  Any carried \nforward text messages also do not expire. Data allowances do not carry forward. Additional data is \ncharged in packs, with a fixed cost for every additional pack of data required. You cannot purchase a \npartial data pack. \n\nJOINING INCENTIVES \nEach plan has an incentive on offer to encourage new customers to sign up. The incentives are detailed \nbelow. \nThese incentives are only used to answers questions 49 to 52. Do not include them when \ncompleting questions 43 to 48. \n\nCarrier  Incentive\nRun      First two months of the plan, the base cost is free of charge.\nSwim     First six months have a 50% discount on the base cost of the plan.\nBike     First three months have a 60% discount on the total cost of the plan (base cost and any additional usage charges).\nJump     An extra 1,000MB of data included for each of the first 9 months.\nKayak    Double the allocation of included minutes for the first 4 months.\nSkip     Double the allocation of included data for the first 3 months.\n\n\nYOUR USAGE \nYou expect: \n your standard monthly usage to be 300 minutes, 1,000 text messages and 2,000MB of data.\n to use 1.5x your standard amount of minutes, text messages and data every June and July and 2x\nyour standard monthly usage of minutes, text messages and data every December.  \n your standard monthly usage to increase by 5% per annum (effective from 1 January each year).\nFor the purpose of this analysis, partial minutes, text messages and MB of data are allowed \n(i.e., do not round this annual increase). Assume that partial additional minutes and partial \nadditional text messages can be purchased at a pro-rata price. \n\nQuestion 10\nYou have a friend who is also considering the same plans. They expect to have a standard\nmonthly usage of minutes, text messages and data that is half of your expected usage. They have\nthe same monthly factors and annual growth % estimates as you.\nWhich carrier would be the cheapest for your friend over 36 months  (including the incentive\nplans) ? [3 marks]\na. Run\nb.

                  DSBench/data/00000029, INTRODUCTION\nIt is your first day at a new employer, a massive company that produces widgets. The company has a \nbasic 15 year forecasting model including a profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow \nstatement. The previous analyst has already left and there was no chance for a proper handover.  \nFortunately they left you with a series of notes that set out where they believe there are issues in the \ncurrent model. You are required to identify and fix these errors so you can brief the CFO on the model \noutputs. \nFor each question below, you will be provided with the previous analyst’s note on where they thought an \nerror existed. You will be required to find and correct the error. To assist with this, you are also provided \nthe cell reference for where the error(s) are located.  \nOnce the error(s) are fixed, you will be able to select the correct answer from the multiple choice options \navailable. \nYOU MUST complete the questions in sequence. Ensure your model has the correct answer before \ncontinuing. When making your changes, make sure the change is made across the whole row. \nYou should not have to insert any rows or columns to fix the errors in the model. If you do insert rows or \ncolumns the cell references below will no longer line up to the model. \n \n\nQuestion 1 \nAnalyst comment: “ Something isn’t working in the volume summary by type”  \n[Error (s) in Calculations!6 :20] \nWhat is the total volume  of units (in millions)  across the 1 5 year period for ‘Low value’  widgets ? \na. 4,829.07  \nb. 4,829. 28 \nc. 4,829. 39 \nd. 4,829. 42 \ne. 4,829. 68 \nf. 4,829. 72 \n \n

       DSBench/data/00000029, INTRODUCTION\nIt is your first day at a new employer, a massive company that produces widgets. The company has a \nbasic 15 year forecasting model including a profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow \nstatement. The previous analyst has already left and there was no chance for a proper handover.  \nFortunately they left you with a series of notes that set out where they believe there are issues in the \ncurrent model. You are required to identify and fix these errors so you can brief the CFO on the model \noutputs. \nFor each question below, you will be provided with the previous analyst’s note on where they thought an \nerror existed. You will be required to find and correct the error. To assist with this, you are also provided \nthe cell reference for where the error(s) are located.  \nOnce the error(s) are fixed, you will be able to select the correct answer from the multiple choice options \navailable. \nYOU MUST complete the questions in sequence. Ensure your model has the correct answer before \ncontinuing. When making your changes, make sure the change is made across the whole row. \nYou should not have to insert any rows or columns to fix the errors in the model. If you do insert rows or \ncolumns the cell references below will no longer line up to the model. \n \n\nQuestion 2 \nAnalyst comment: “The scenario selector doesn’t seem to be working properl y” \n[Error(s) in Calculations!22 :33] \nWhat is the total revenue  ($m)  in the Year ending June 2023 under the Base scenario ? \na. 68,560.10 \nb. 68,560.28  \nc. 68,560.47 \nd. 68,560.59 \ne. 68,560.71 \nf. 68,560.98 \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

 DSBench/data/00000029, INTRODUCTION\nIt is your first day at a new employer, a massive company that produces widgets. The company has a \nbasic 15 year forecasting model including a profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow \nstatement. The previous analyst has already left and there was no chance for a proper handover.  \nFortunately they left you with a series of notes that set out where they believe there are issues in the \ncurrent model. You are required to identify and fix these errors so you can brief the CFO on the model \noutputs. \nFor each question below, you will be provided with the previous analyst’s note on where they thought an \nerror existed. You will be required to find and correct the error. To assist with this, you are also provided \nthe cell reference for where the error(s) are located.  \nOnce the error(s) are fixed, you will be able to select the correct answer from the multiple choice options \navailable. \nYOU MUST complete the questions in sequence. Ensure your model has the correct answer before \ncontinuing. When making your changes, make sure the change is made across the whole row. \nYou should not have to insert any rows or columns to fix the errors in the model. If you do insert rows or \ncolumns the cell references below will no longer line up to the model. \n \n\nQuestion 3  \nAnalyst comment: “ Our total expenses look ok in year one but seem to be overstated further on ” \n[Error (s) in Calculations!5 2:65] \nWhat is the figure for total expenses ($m) in the Year ending June 2025  under the Base scenario ? \na. 18,517.04 \nb. 18,517.12 \nc. 18,517.37  \nd. 18,517.46 \ne. 18,517.68 \nf. 18,517.97 \n

DSBench/data/00000029, INTRODUCTION\nIt is your first day at a new employer, a massive company that produces widgets. The company has a \nbasic 15 year forecasting model including a profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow \nstatement. The previous analyst has already left and there was no chance for a proper handover.  \nFortunately they left you with a series of notes that set out where they believe there are issues in the \ncurrent model. You are required to identify and fix these errors so you can brief the CFO on the model \noutputs. \nFor each question below, you will be provided with the previous analyst’s note on where they thought an \nerror existed. You will be required to find and correct the error. To assist with this, you are also provided \nthe cell reference for where the error(s) are located.  \nOnce the error(s) are fixed, you will be able to select the correct answer from the multiple choice options \navailable. \nYOU MUST complete the questions in sequence. Ensure your model has the correct answer before \ncontinuing. When making your changes, make sure the change is made across the whole row. \nYou should not have to insert any rows or columns to fix the errors in the model. If you do insert rows or \ncolumns the cell references below will no longer line up to the model. \n \n\nQuestion 4  \nAnalyst comment: “ Our working capital requirements don’t seem correct”  \n[Error (s) in Calculations! 71:89] \nWhat is the change in net working capital ($m) in the Year ending June 2019 under the Base \nscenario ? \na.

DSBench/data/00000029, INTRODUCTION\nIt is your first day at a new employer, a massive company that produces widgets. The company has a \nbasic 15 year forecasting model including a profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow \nstatement. The previous analyst has already left and there was no chance for a proper handover.  \nFortunately they left you with a series of notes that set out where they believe there are issues in the \ncurrent model. You are required to identify and fix these errors so you can brief the CFO on the model \noutputs. \nFor each question below, you will be provided with the previous analyst’s note on where they thought an \nerror existed. You will be required to find and correct the error. To assist with this, you are also provided \nthe cell reference for where the error(s) are located.  \nOnce the error(s) are fixed, you will be able to select the correct answer from the multiple choice options \navailable. \nYOU MUST complete the questions in sequence. Ensure your model has the correct answer before \ncontinuing. When making your changes, make sure the change is made across the whole row. \nYou should not have to insert any rows or columns to fix the errors in the model. If you do insert rows or \ncolumns the cell references below will no longer line up to the model. \n \n\nQuestion 5  \nAnalyst comment: “ Our accounting specialist thinks our  year 1 5 closing net book value (from an \naccounting perspective) is understated”  \n[Error (s) in Calculations!91:1 20] \nWhat is the closing accounting net book value  ($m) in the Year ending June 20 30? \na. 6,211.04 \nb. 6,211.14 \nc. 6,211.27  \nd. 6,211.39 \ne. 6,211.57 \nf. 6,211.62 \n

                 DSBench/data/00000029, INTRODUCTION\nIt is your first day at a new employer, a massive company that produces widgets. The company has a \nbasic 15 year forecasting model including a profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow \nstatement. The previous analyst has already left and there was no chance for a proper handover.  \nFortunately they left you with a series of notes that set out where they believe there are issues in the \ncurrent model. You are required to identify and fix these errors so you can brief the CFO on the model \noutputs. \nFor each question below, you will be provided with the previous analyst’s note on where they thought an \nerror existed. You will be required to find and correct the error. To assist with this, you are also provided \nthe cell reference for where the error(s) are located.  \nOnce the error(s) are fixed, you will be able to select the correct answer from the multiple choice options \navailable. \nYOU MUST complete the questions in sequence. Ensure your model has the correct answer before \ncontinuing. When making your changes, make sure the change is made across the whole row. \nYou should not have to insert any rows or columns to fix the errors in the model. If you do insert rows or \ncolumns the cell references below will no longer line up to the model. \n \n\nQuestion 8  \nAnalyst comment: “ The total interest on the term loans seems wrong ” \n[Error (s) in Calculations!1 83:202] \nWhat is the total interest on the three Term Loans  ($m) in the Year ending June 20 28? \na. 996.00 \nb. 997.00  \nc. 998.00 \nd. 999.00 \ne. 1,000 .00 \nf. 1,001 .00 \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

The company has a \nbasic 15 year forecasting model including a profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow \nstatement. The previous analyst has already left and there was no chance for a proper handover.  \nFortunately they left you with a series of notes that set out where they believe there are issues in the \ncurrent model. You are required to identify and fix these errors so you can brief the CFO on the model \noutputs. \nFor each question below, you will be provided with the previous analyst’s note on where they thought an \nerror existed. You will be required to find and correct the error. To assist with this, you are also provided \nthe cell reference for where the error(s) are located.  \nOnce the error(s) are fixed, you will be able to select the correct answer from the multiple choice options \navailable. \nYOU MUST complete the questions in sequence. Ensure your model has the correct answer before \ncontinuing. When making your changes, make sure the change is made across the whole row. \nYou should not have to insert any rows or columns to fix the errors in the model. If you do insert rows or \ncolumns the cell references below will no longer line up to the model. \n \n\nQuestion 9  \nAnalyst comment: “ The tax payable isn’t quite calculated correctly”  \n[Error (s) in Calculations! 212:229] \nWhat is the figure for tax payable ($m) in the Year ending June 2019 under the Base scenario ? \na. 1,111.24 \nb. 1,111.47 \nc. 1,111.56 \nd. 1,111.65 \ne. 1,111.80 \nf. 1,111.92  \n \n

The company has a \nbasic 15 year forecasting model including a profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow \nstatement. The previous analyst has already left and there was no chance for a proper handover.  \nFortunately they left you with a series of notes that set out where they believe there are issues in the \ncurrent model. You are required to identify and fix these errors so you can brief the CFO on the model \noutputs. \nFor each question below, you will be provided with the previous analyst’s note on where they thought an \nerror existed. You will be required to find and correct the error. To assist with this, you are also provided \nthe cell reference for where the error(s) are located.  \nOnce the error(s) are fixed, you will be able to select the correct answer from the multiple choice options \navailable. \nYOU MUST complete the questions in sequence. Ensure your model has the correct answer before \ncontinuing. When making your changes, make sure the change is made across the whole row. \nYou should not have to insert any rows or columns to fix the errors in the model. If you do insert rows or \ncolumns the cell references below will no longer line up to the model. \n \n\nQuestion 10  \nAnalyst comment: “ The balance sheet doesn’t balance”  \n[Error (s) in Outputs! 27:67] \nWhat is the total net assets ($m) in the June 20 30 year under the Base scenario ? \na. 8,085.44 \nb. 8,085.55 \nc. 8,085.66 \nd. 8,085.77 \ne. 8,085.88 \nf. 8,085.99  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

DSBench/data/00000030, INTRODUCTION\nNote: This question should be read along with the accompanying workbook \nYou work in the business development team of ETech, a technology company that primarily operates out \nof Europe and prepares its financial statements in Euros.   \nETech has a comprehensive corporate model that you use to analyse the impact of any potential \nacquisitions. The corporate model is prepared in Euros on a nominal basis therefore any acquisition \nanalysis needs to be converted to nominal Euros to correctly interface with the corporate model.  \nETech has been approached by JL Goodward, a well-known investment banking firm on behalf of their \nclient GEE, a conglomerate. GEE is looking to divest its technology division and has put a sale process in \nplace. Your mangers and board of directors are excited by the prospect of acquiring GEE’s technology \ndivision and have requested entry into the sales process. \nWith all the legal formalities out of the way, JL Goodward sends you an Information Memorandum (‘IM’) to \nassist you with preparing your Indicative Bid. In the IM you have been provided with management’s \nforecast performance of the business.  \nThe forecast includes sales, opex and capex in real US$ and the opening balance of the two classes of \ntax assets in US$.  You are instructed to ignore all other assets and liabilities for the purpose of preparing \nyour Indicative Bid. Furthermore you are instructed to make the following assumptions: \n    • GEE’s effective tax rate is 40%. Tax is calculated on the last day of the year and paid\n    immediately. Corporate tax will continue to be payable within the US.\n    • That all cash flows (Sales, Opex, Capex etc) happen on the last day of the year.\n    • Depreciation for Tax and Accounting is done using:\n        o For Class A assets, the double declining balance method over 5 years.\n        o For Class B assets, the straight line method over 4 years. Assume the opening balance\nhas not yet been depreciated and will be depreciated over 4 years starting in 2015. \nIn order to prepare your bid, you have talked to your tax advisors, investment committee and ETech’s \nmanagement. Based on these discussions, you have settled on the following assumptions relevant to your \nvaluation: \n    • There are no cross border implications from the acquisition;\n    • You will discount pre financing, post-tax nominal US$ cash flows using a 10% rate in order to\nvalue the assets as at 31 December 2014; \n    • The spot exchange rate as at the valuation date will be 1.31 US$ per 1 Euro;\n    • You are provided with a real US$:Euro exchange rate and told that it has been calculated as a\nnotional exchange rate that can be used to convert directly between real US$ and real Euro. \nHint: Do not use these rates to directly convert between nominal US$ and nominal Euro. \n    • You have formed a view on inflation for both the US$ and Euro, included in the provided\nworkbook. \n \n \n\nQuestion 1 What is the nominal US$:Euro exchange rate in year 7?  a. 1.297 b. 1.308 c. 1.312 d. 1.324

The corporate model is prepared in Euros on a nominal basis therefore any acquisition \nanalysis needs to be converted to nominal Euros to correctly interface with the corporate model.  \nETech has been approached by JL Goodward, a well-known investment banking firm on behalf of their \nclient GEE, a conglomerate. GEE is looking to divest its technology division and has put a sale process in \nplace. Your mangers and board of directors are excited by the prospect of acquiring GEE’s technology \ndivision and have requested entry into the sales process. \nWith all the legal formalities out of the way, JL Goodward sends you an Information Memorandum (‘IM’) to \nassist you with preparing your Indicative Bid. In the IM you have been provided with management’s \nforecast performance of the business.  \nThe forecast includes sales, opex and capex in real US$ and the opening balance of the two classes of \ntax assets in US$.  You are instructed to ignore all other assets and liabilities for the purpose of preparing \nyour Indicative Bid. Furthermore you are instructed to make the following assumptions: \n    • GEE’s effective tax rate is 40%. Tax is calculated on the last day of the year and paid\n    immediately. Corporate tax will continue to be payable within the US.\n    • That all cash flows (Sales, Opex, Capex etc) happen on the last day of the year.\n    • Depreciation for Tax and Accounting is done using:\n        o For Class A assets, the double declining balance method over 5 years.\n        o For Class B assets, the straight line method over 4 years. Assume the opening balance\nhas not yet been depreciated and will be depreciated over 4 years starting in 2015. \nIn order to prepare your bid, you have talked to your tax advisors, investment committee and ETech’s \nmanagement. Based on these discussions, you have settled on the following assumptions relevant to your \nvaluation: \n    • There are no cross border implications from the acquisition;\n    • You will discount pre financing, post-tax nominal US$ cash flows using a 10% rate in order to\nvalue the assets as at 31 December 2014; \n    • The spot exchange rate as at the valuation date will be 1.31 US$ per 1 Euro;\n    • You are provided with a real US$:Euro exchange rate and told that it has been calculated as a\nnotional exchange rate that can be used to convert directly between real US$ and real Euro. \nHint: Do not use these rates to directly convert between nominal US$ and nominal Euro. \n    • You have formed a view on inflation for both the US$ and Euro, included in the provided\nworkbook. \n \n \n\nQuestion 2 What is Revenue in Year 2 in nominal Euros?  a. 740m b. 745m c. 1,214m d. 1,220m

INTRODUCTION\nNote: This question should be read along with the accompanying workbook \nYou work in the business development team of ETech, a technology company that primarily operates out \nof Europe and prepares its financial statements in Euros.   \nETech has a comprehensive corporate model that you use to analyse the impact of any potential \nacquisitions. The corporate model is prepared in Euros on a nominal basis therefore any acquisition \nanalysis needs to be converted to nominal Euros to correctly interface with the corporate model.  \nETech has been approached by JL Goodward, a well-known investment banking firm on behalf of their \nclient GEE, a conglomerate. GEE is looking to divest its technology division and has put a sale process in \nplace. Your mangers and board of directors are excited by the prospect of acquiring GEE’s technology \ndivision and have requested entry into the sales process. \nWith all the legal formalities out of the way, JL Goodward sends you an Information Memorandum (‘IM’) to \nassist you with preparing your Indicative Bid. In the IM you have been provided with management’s \nforecast performance of the business.  \nThe forecast includes sales, opex and capex in real US$ and the opening balance of the two classes of \ntax assets in US$.  You are instructed to ignore all other assets and liabilities for the purpose of preparing \nyour Indicative Bid. Furthermore you are instructed to make the following assumptions: \n    • GEE’s effective tax rate is 40%. Tax is calculated on the last day of the year and paid\n    immediately. Corporate tax will continue to be payable within the US.\n    • That all cash flows (Sales, Opex, Capex etc) happen on the last day of the year.\n    • Depreciation for Tax and Accounting is done using:\n        o For Class A assets, the double declining balance method over 5 years.\n        o For Class B assets, the straight line method over 4 years. Assume the opening balance\nhas not yet been depreciated and will be depreciated over 4 years starting in 2015. \nIn order to prepare your bid, you have talked to your tax advisors, investment committee and ETech’s \nmanagement. Based on these discussions, you have settled on the following assumptions relevant to your \nvaluation: \n    • There are no cross border implications from the acquisition;\n    • You will discount pre financing, post-tax nominal US$ cash flows using a 10% rate in order to\nvalue the assets as at 31 December 2014; \n    • The spot exchange rate as at the valuation date will be 1.31 US$ per 1 Euro;\n    • You are provided with a real US$:Euro exchange rate and told that it has been calculated as a\nnotional exchange rate that can be used to convert directly between real US$ and real Euro. \nHint: Do not use these rates to directly convert between nominal US$ and nominal Euro. \n    • You have formed a view on inflation for both the US$ and Euro, included in the provided\nworkbook. \n \n \n\nQuestion 4 What is Net Profit Before Tax (Net Income) in Year 4 in nominal Euros?  a. 44.4m b. 44.8m c. 45.2m d. 45.6m

DSBench/data/00000030, INTRODUCTION\nNote: This question should be read along with the accompanying workbook \nYou work in the business development team of ETech, a technology company that primarily operates out \nof Europe and prepares its financial statements in Euros.   \nETech has a comprehensive corporate model that you use to analyse the impact of any potential \nacquisitions. The corporate model is prepared in Euros on a nominal basis therefore any acquisition \nanalysis needs to be converted to nominal Euros to correctly interface with the corporate model.  \nETech has been approached by JL Goodward, a well-known investment banking firm on behalf of their \nclient GEE, a conglomerate. GEE is looking to divest its technology division and has put a sale process in \nplace. Your mangers and board of directors are excited by the prospect of acquiring GEE’s technology \ndivision and have requested entry into the sales process. \nWith all the legal formalities out of the way, JL Goodward sends you an Information Memorandum (‘IM’) to \nassist you with preparing your Indicative Bid. In the IM you have been provided with management’s \nforecast performance of the business.  \nThe forecast includes sales, opex and capex in real US$ and the opening balance of the two classes of \ntax assets in US$.  You are instructed to ignore all other assets and liabilities for the purpose of preparing \nyour Indicative Bid. Furthermore you are instructed to make the following assumptions: \n    • GEE’s effective tax rate is 40%. Tax is calculated on the last day of the year and paid\n    immediately. Corporate tax will continue to be payable within the US.\n    • That all cash flows (Sales, Opex, Capex etc) happen on the last day of the year.\n    • Depreciation for Tax and Accounting is done using:\n        o For Class A assets, the double declining balance method over 5 years.\n        o For Class B assets, the straight line method over 4 years. Assume the opening balance\nhas not yet been depreciated and will be depreciated over 4 years starting in 2015. \nIn order to prepare your bid, you have talked to your tax advisors, investment committee and ETech’s \nmanagement. Based on these discussions, you have settled on the following assumptions relevant to your \nvaluation: \n    • There are no cross border implications from the acquisition;\n    • You will discount pre financing, post-tax nominal US$ cash flows using a 10% rate in order to\nvalue the assets as at 31 December 2014; \n    • The spot exchange rate as at the valuation date will be 1.31 US$ per 1 Euro;\n    • You are provided with a real US$:Euro exchange rate and told that it has been calculated as a\nnotional exchange rate that can be used to convert directly between real US$ and real Euro. \nHint: Do not use these rates to directly convert between nominal US$ and nominal Euro. \n    • You have formed a view on inflation for both the US$ and Euro, included in the provided\nworkbook. \n \n \n\nQuestion 5 What is the Tax Expense in Year 8 in nominal Euros?    a. 76m b. 78m c. 80m d. 82m

Your mangers and board of directors are excited by the prospect of acquiring GEE’s technology \ndivision and have requested entry into the sales process. \nWith all the legal formalities out of the way, JL Goodward sends you an Information Memorandum (‘IM’) to \nassist you with preparing your Indicative Bid. In the IM you have been provided with management’s \nforecast performance of the business.  \nThe forecast includes sales, opex and capex in real US$ and the opening balance of the two classes of \ntax assets in US$.  You are instructed to ignore all other assets and liabilities for the purpose of preparing \nyour Indicative Bid. Furthermore you are instructed to make the following assumptions: \n    • GEE’s effective tax rate is 40%. Tax is calculated on the last day of the year and paid\n    immediately. Corporate tax will continue to be payable within the US.\n    • That all cash flows (Sales, Opex, Capex etc) happen on the last day of the year.\n    • Depreciation for Tax and Accounting is done using:\n        o For Class A assets, the double declining balance method over 5 years.\n        o For Class B assets, the straight line method over 4 years. Assume the opening balance\nhas not yet been depreciated and will be depreciated over 4 years starting in 2015. \nIn order to prepare your bid, you have talked to your tax advisors, investment committee and ETech’s \nmanagement. Based on these discussions, you have settled on the following assumptions relevant to your \nvaluation: \n    • There are no cross border implications from the acquisition;\n    • You will discount pre financing, post-tax nominal US$ cash flows using a 10% rate in order to\nvalue the assets as at 31 December 2014; \n    • The spot exchange rate as at the valuation date will be 1.31 US$ per 1 Euro;\n    • You are provided with a real US$:Euro exchange rate and told that it has been calculated as a\nnotional exchange rate that can be used to convert directly between real US$ and real Euro. \nHint: Do not use these rates to directly convert between nominal US$ and nominal Euro. \n    • You have formed a view on inflation for both the US$ and Euro, included in the provided\nworkbook. \n \n \n\nQuestion 6 Using the NPV function, what is the Present Value as at 31 December 2014 of the first 10 years of cash flow in nominal Euros?  a. 515m b. 519m c. 522m d. 523m

and ladders. Both players begin on the \nstart square and take turns rolling a standard 6-sided die. You move forward the number of places rolled \non the die. If you land on a square that is at the very bottom of a ladder, you move to the top of the ladder. \nIf you land on a snake head, you slide down to the bottom of the snake. The winner is the first player to \nthe finish square, an exact roll is not required to finish.  \nBeing a keen Excel user, you decide to simulate the game. Using your preferred method (e.g. a data \ntable, VBA, or any other means within Excel) simulate exactly 5,000 games of snakes and ladders, and \nthen answer the following questions. \nDo not simulate more than 5,000 games at once, as this could increase your workbook size too much.  \nHowever be sure to run your 5,000 game simulation a few times to make sure your first result was not an \noutlier.  \nFor the questions that follow: \n     ‘Player 1’ refers to the player who moves first and ‘Player 2’ the player who moves second.\n     You may wish to run your simulation several times to ensure your results are consistent.\n     Your answers may not match exactly those provided, given the nature of simulation and the\n    rounding of the provided answers.  Select the closest answer.\n\n \nTHE BOARD \n\nYou use the board (as shown in the image)  to play the game.\n \nFor clarity, details of the board are as follows: \nThe ‘Start’ square is numbered 0, and the ‘Finish’ square is numbered 34. \n \nThe board contains the following ladders:\ni) 1 → 12\nii) 5 → 16\niii) 11 → 22\niv) 15 → 23\nv) 20 → 31\n\nThe board contains the following snakes:\ni) 7 → 4\nii) 10 → 2\niii) 21 → 13\niv) 24 → 6\nv) 33 → 19\n\nQuestion 1 \nIf you played the game by yourself, what is the average number of rolls required to finish?  \na. 7 rolls  \nb. 9 rolls  \nc. 11 rolls  \nd. 13 rolls  \n

Both players begin on the \nstart square and take turns rolling a standard 6-sided die. You move forward the number of places rolled \non the die. If you land on a square that is at the very bottom of a ladder, you move to the top of the ladder. \nIf you land on a snake head, you slide down to the bottom of the snake. The winner is the first player to \nthe finish square, an exact roll is not required to finish.  \nBeing a keen Excel user, you decide to simulate the game. Using your preferred method (e.g. a data \ntable, VBA, or any other means within Excel) simulate exactly 5,000 games of snakes and ladders, and \nthen answer the following questions. \nDo not simulate more than 5,000 games at once, as this could increase your workbook size too much.  \nHowever be sure to run your 5,000 game simulation a few times to make sure your first result was not an \noutlier.  \nFor the questions that follow: \n     ‘Player 1’ refers to the player who moves first and ‘Player 2’ the player who moves second.\n     You may wish to run your simulation several times to ensure your results are consistent.\n     Your answers may not match exactly those provided, given the nature of simulation and the\n    rounding of the provided answers.  Select the closest answer.\n\n \nTHE BOARD \n\nYou use the board (as shown in the image)  to play the game.\n \nFor clarity, details of the board are as follows: \nThe ‘Start’ square is numbered 0, and the ‘Finish’ square is numbered 34. \n \nThe board contains the following ladders:\ni) 1 → 12\nii) 5 → 16\niii) 11 → 22\niv) 15 → 23\nv) 20 → 31\n\nThe board contains the following snakes:\ni) 7 → 4\nii) 10 → 2\niii) 21 → 13\niv) 24 → 6\nv) 33 → 19\n\nQuestion 2  \nIn a two person game, what is the average number of combined rolls by both players required for \nthe game to finish?  \na. 13 rolls \nb. 15 rolls \nc. 17 rolls \nd. 19 rolls \n

board game of snakes and ladders. Both players begin on the \nstart square and take turns rolling a standard 6-sided die. You move forward the number of places rolled \non the die. If you land on a square that is at the very bottom of a ladder, you move to the top of the ladder. \nIf you land on a snake head, you slide down to the bottom of the snake. The winner is the first player to \nthe finish square, an exact roll is not required to finish.  \nBeing a keen Excel user, you decide to simulate the game. Using your preferred method (e.g. a data \ntable, VBA, or any other means within Excel) simulate exactly 5,000 games of snakes and ladders, and \nthen answer the following questions. \nDo not simulate more than 5,000 games at once, as this could increase your workbook size too much.  \nHowever be sure to run your 5,000 game simulation a few times to make sure your first result was not an \noutlier.  \nFor the questions that follow: \n     ‘Player 1’ refers to the player who moves first and ‘Player 2’ the player who moves second.\n     You may wish to run your simulation several times to ensure your results are consistent.\n     Your answers may not match exactly those provided, given the nature of simulation and the\n    rounding of the provided answers.  Select the closest answer.\n\n \nTHE BOARD \n\nYou use the board (as shown in the image)  to play the game.\n \nFor clarity, details of the board are as follows: \nThe ‘Start’ square is numbered 0, and the ‘Finish’ square is numbered 34. \n \nThe board contains the following ladders:\ni) 1 → 12\nii) 5 → 16\niii) 11 → 22\niv) 15 → 23\nv) 20 → 31\n\nThe board contains the following snakes:\ni) 7 → 4\nii) 10 → 2\niii) 21 → 13\niv) 24 → 6\nv) 33 → 19\n\nQuestion 3 \nIn a two person game, what is the probability that Player 1 wins?  \na. 50% \nb. 53% \nc. 57% \nd. 60% \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

playing the classic board game of snakes and ladders. Both players begin on the \nstart square and take turns rolling a standard 6-sided die. You move forward the number of places rolled \non the die. If you land on a square that is at the very bottom of a ladder, you move to the top of the ladder. \nIf you land on a snake head, you slide down to the bottom of the snake. The winner is the first player to \nthe finish square, an exact roll is not required to finish.  \nBeing a keen Excel user, you decide to simulate the game. Using your preferred method (e.g. a data \ntable, VBA, or any other means within Excel) simulate exactly 5,000 games of snakes and ladders, and \nthen answer the following questions. \nDo not simulate more than 5,000 games at once, as this could increase your workbook size too much.  \nHowever be sure to run your 5,000 game simulation a few times to make sure your first result was not an \noutlier.  \nFor the questions that follow: \n     ‘Player 1’ refers to the player who moves first and ‘Player 2’ the player who moves second.\n     You may wish to run your simulation several times to ensure your results are consistent.\n     Your answers may not match exactly those provided, given the nature of simulation and the\n    rounding of the provided answers.  Select the closest answer.\n\n \nTHE BOARD \n\nYou use the board (as shown in the image)  to play the game.\n \nFor clarity, details of the board are as follows: \nThe ‘Start’ square is numbered 0, and the ‘Finish’ square is numbered 34. \n \nThe board contains the following ladders:\ni) 1 → 12\nii) 5 → 16\niii) 11 → 22\niv) 15 → 23\nv) 20 → 31\n\nThe board contains the following snakes:\ni) 7 → 4\nii) 10 → 2\niii) 21 → 13\niv) 24 → 6\nv) 33 → 19\n\nQuestion 4 \nYou decide you want the game to have approximately fair o dds, and you do this by changing the \nsquare that Player 2 starts on . From the options below, which square for Player 2’s start position \ngives the closest to equal odds for both players ? \na. Square 3  \nb. Square 6  \nc. Square 9  \nd. Square 12  \n

the classic board game of snakes and ladders. Both players begin on the \nstart square and take turns rolling a standard 6-sided die. You move forward the number of places rolled \non the die. If you land on a square that is at the very bottom of a ladder, you move to the top of the ladder. \nIf you land on a snake head, you slide down to the bottom of the snake. The winner is the first player to \nthe finish square, an exact roll is not required to finish.  \nBeing a keen Excel user, you decide to simulate the game. Using your preferred method (e.g. a data \ntable, VBA, or any other means within Excel) simulate exactly 5,000 games of snakes and ladders, and \nthen answer the following questions. \nDo not simulate more than 5,000 games at once, as this could increase your workbook size too much.  \nHowever be sure to run your 5,000 game simulation a few times to make sure your first result was not an \noutlier.  \nFor the questions that follow: \n     ‘Player 1’ refers to the player who moves first and ‘Player 2’ the player who moves second.\n     You may wish to run your simulation several times to ensure your results are consistent.\n     Your answers may not match exactly those provided, given the nature of simulation and the\n    rounding of the provided answers.  Select the closest answer.\n\n \nTHE BOARD \n\nYou use the board (as shown in the image)  to play the game.\n \nFor clarity, details of the board are as follows: \nThe ‘Start’ square is numbered 0, and the ‘Finish’ square is numbered 34. \n \nThe board contains the following ladders:\ni) 1 → 12\nii) 5 → 16\niii) 11 → 22\niv) 15 → 23\nv) 20 → 31\n\nThe board contains the following snakes:\ni) 7 → 4\nii) 10 → 2\niii) 21 → 13\niv) 24 → 6\nv) 33 → 19\n\nQuestion 5 \nIn a different attempt to change the odds of the game, i nstead of starting Player 2 on a different \nsquare, you decide to give Player 2 immunity to the first snake that they land on . What is the \napproximate probability that Player 1 wins now?  \na. 42.5 % \nb. 46.5% \nc. 49.5% \nd. 52 .5% \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

INTRODUCTION\n \nJust over a year ago you had a smart electricity meter installed at your home. This particular model of \nsmart meter reports your usage to your electricity provider every hour. Your electricity contract is due for \nrenewal and being a top financial analyst you decide to identify which contract will minimise your annual \nelectricity cost. \nThere are 3 different types of electricity contracts available to you. Each are described in the table below: \n\nPlan          Explanations\nNo Flex       The cost per kWh of electricity is constant for the entire year\nMonthly Flex  The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates depending on the month\nHourly Flex   The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates based on the time of day\n\n \nTo decide which contract is optimal, you decide to compare the costs under each of the contracts \nassuming your usage remains exactly the same as last year. You've contacted your current electricity \nsupplier to obtain your electricity usage history for the last year. Unfortunately they provided it to you in a \npoorly structured and unsorted format, so you will need to clean it up prior to doing your analysis. In the \ndata the hour field identifies when the hour starts, so 8AM would be from 8:00AM until 8:59AM. \n \nSUPPORTING DATA \n \nYou’ve placed your usage history and the specifics of each of the electricity contracts into the supplied \nworkbook. Your usage history is located on the “Usage” sheet while the specifics about each of the \nelectricity contracts is located on the “Contracts” sheet. \n\n\nQuestion 1 What is your average hourly electricity usage?  a. 0.641kWh b. 0.782kWh c. 0.884kWh d. 0.937kWh

INTRODUCTION\n \nJust over a year ago you had a smart electricity meter installed at your home. This particular model of \nsmart meter reports your usage to your electricity provider every hour. Your electricity contract is due for \nrenewal and being a top financial analyst you decide to identify which contract will minimise your annual \nelectricity cost. \nThere are 3 different types of electricity contracts available to you. Each are described in the table below: \n\nPlan          Explanations\nNo Flex       The cost per kWh of electricity is constant for the entire year\nMonthly Flex  The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates depending on the month\nHourly Flex   The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates based on the time of day\n\n \nTo decide which contract is optimal, you decide to compare the costs under each of the contracts \nassuming your usage remains exactly the same as last year. You've contacted your current electricity \nsupplier to obtain your electricity usage history for the last year. Unfortunately they provided it to you in a \npoorly structured and unsorted format, so you will need to clean it up prior to doing your analysis. In the \ndata the hour field identifies when the hour starts, so 8AM would be from 8:00AM until 8:59AM. \n \nSUPPORTING DATA \n \nYou’ve placed your usage history and the specifics of each of the electricity contracts into the supplied \nworkbook. Your usage history is located on the “Usage” sheet while the specifics about each of the \nelectricity contracts is located on the “Contracts” sheet. \n\n\nQuestion 3 Which day of the week has the highest average usage?  a.  Sunday b.  Monday c.  Tuesday d.  Wednesday

a smart electricity meter installed at your home. This particular model of \nsmart meter reports your usage to your electricity provider every hour. Your electricity contract is due for \nrenewal and being a top financial analyst you decide to identify which contract will minimise your annual \nelectricity cost. \nThere are 3 different types of electricity contracts available to you. Each are described in the table below: \n\nPlan          Explanations\nNo Flex       The cost per kWh of electricity is constant for the entire year\nMonthly Flex  The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates depending on the month\nHourly Flex   The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates based on the time of day\n\n \nTo decide which contract is optimal, you decide to compare the costs under each of the contracts \nassuming your usage remains exactly the same as last year. You've contacted your current electricity \nsupplier to obtain your electricity usage history for the last year. Unfortunately they provided it to you in a \npoorly structured and unsorted format, so you will need to clean it up prior to doing your analysis. In the \ndata the hour field identifies when the hour starts, so 8AM would be from 8:00AM until 8:59AM. \n \nSUPPORTING DATA \n \nYou’ve placed your usage history and the specifics of each of the electricity contracts into the supplied \nworkbook. Your usage history is located on the “Usage” sheet while the specifics about each of the \nelectricity contracts is located on the “Contracts” sheet. \n\n\nQuestion 4 What is the highest amount of electricity used in a continuous 4 hour period?  a. 17.237kWh b. 17.327kWh c. 17.422kWh d. 17.487kWh

at your home. This particular model of \nsmart meter reports your usage to your electricity provider every hour. Your electricity contract is due for \nrenewal and being a top financial analyst you decide to identify which contract will minimise your annual \nelectricity cost. \nThere are 3 different types of electricity contracts available to you. Each are described in the table below: \n\nPlan          Explanations\nNo Flex       The cost per kWh of electricity is constant for the entire year\nMonthly Flex  The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates depending on the month\nHourly Flex   The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates based on the time of day\n\n \nTo decide which contract is optimal, you decide to compare the costs under each of the contracts \nassuming your usage remains exactly the same as last year. You've contacted your current electricity \nsupplier to obtain your electricity usage history for the last year. Unfortunately they provided it to you in a \npoorly structured and unsorted format, so you will need to clean it up prior to doing your analysis. In the \ndata the hour field identifies when the hour starts, so 8AM would be from 8:00AM until 8:59AM. \n \nSUPPORTING DATA \n \nYou’ve placed your usage history and the specifics of each of the electricity contracts into the supplied \nworkbook. Your usage history is located on the “Usage” sheet while the specifics about each of the \nelectricity contracts is located on the “Contracts” sheet. \n\n\nQuestion 5 Based on your historic electricity usage, what would your annual cost of electricity be under the "Monthly Flex" contract?  a.  $1350.73 b.  $1421.82 c.  $1450.26 d.  $1493.77

at your home. This particular model of \nsmart meter reports your usage to your electricity provider every hour. Your electricity contract is due for \nrenewal and being a top financial analyst you decide to identify which contract will minimise your annual \nelectricity cost. \nThere are 3 different types of electricity contracts available to you. Each are described in the table below: \n\nPlan          Explanations\nNo Flex       The cost per kWh of electricity is constant for the entire year\nMonthly Flex  The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates depending on the month\nHourly Flex   The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates based on the time of day\n\n \nTo decide which contract is optimal, you decide to compare the costs under each of the contracts \nassuming your usage remains exactly the same as last year. You've contacted your current electricity \nsupplier to obtain your electricity usage history for the last year. Unfortunately they provided it to you in a \npoorly structured and unsorted format, so you will need to clean it up prior to doing your analysis. In the \ndata the hour field identifies when the hour starts, so 8AM would be from 8:00AM until 8:59AM. \n \nSUPPORTING DATA \n \nYou’ve placed your usage history and the specifics of each of the electricity contracts into the supplied \nworkbook. Your usage history is located on the “Usage” sheet while the specifics about each of the \nelectricity contracts is located on the “Contracts” sheet. \n\n\nQuestion 6 Based on your historic electricity usage, what would your annual cost of electricity be under the "Hourly Flex" contract?  a.  $1369.36 b.  $1376.48 c.  $1389.67 d.  $1396.75

This particular model of \nsmart meter reports your usage to your electricity provider every hour. Your electricity contract is due for \nrenewal and being a top financial analyst you decide to identify which contract will minimise your annual \nelectricity cost. \nThere are 3 different types of electricity contracts available to you. Each are described in the table below: \n\nPlan          Explanations\nNo Flex       The cost per kWh of electricity is constant for the entire year\nMonthly Flex  The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates depending on the month\nHourly Flex   The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates based on the time of day\n\n \nTo decide which contract is optimal, you decide to compare the costs under each of the contracts \nassuming your usage remains exactly the same as last year. You've contacted your current electricity \nsupplier to obtain your electricity usage history for the last year. Unfortunately they provided it to you in a \npoorly structured and unsorted format, so you will need to clean it up prior to doing your analysis. In the \ndata the hour field identifies when the hour starts, so 8AM would be from 8:00AM until 8:59AM. \n \nSUPPORTING DATA \n \nYou’ve placed your usage history and the specifics of each of the electricity contracts into the supplied \nworkbook. Your usage history is located on the “Usage” sheet while the specifics about each of the \nelectricity contracts is located on the “Contracts” sheet. \n\n\nQuestion 7 Based on your historic electricity usage, which of the three contracts would produce the lowest annual cost?  a.  The No Flex plan b.  The Monthly Flex plan c.  The Hourly Flex plan d.  Impossible to Determine

The loan details are as follows: \n    • The loan duration can be for any number of months up to 72 months.\n    • Drawdowns occur as a single drawdown for the full balance at the beginning of the loan.\n    • The drawdown can occur on any Business Day. A Business Day is defined as a weekday\n    (Monday to Friday) that is not a Holiday. The list of Holidays has been provided to you.\n    • The Actual Payment Date shall be based on the Regular Payment Date, but adjusted to be a\n    Business Day as described below.\n    • Loan payments are made monthly in arrears, on the Actual Payment Date each month, with the\n    first payment one month after drawdown.\n    • The Regular Payment Date each month will be the same DAY of the month as the loan drawdown\n    (for example, if the drawdown was the 8th of October, then the Regular Payment Date will be the\n    8th of each month).\n    • The Actual Payment Date will equal the Regular Payment Date, subject to the following three\n    conditions:\n \nHINT: For Questions 1-4, you can ignore conditions 2 and 3, as they will not be relevant. \n \nCondition 1:  If the Regular Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the Actual Payment \nDate will be made on the first Business Day after the regular payment date, \nexcept where that Business Day would be in a new calendar month. \n \nHINT: For Questions 5-8, your model will need to also incorporate conditions 2 and 3. \n \nCondition 2: \nIf Condition 1 results in a new calendar month, the Actual Payment Date shall be \nthe last Business Day of the calendar month (which, by definition, will be before \nthe Regular Payment Date) \nCondition 3: \nIf the Regular Payment Date is the 29th, 30th or 31st of the month then, where a \nmonth has fewer days (e.g. February), the Actual Payment Date will be the last \nBusiness Day of the calendar month. \n \n• The Monthly Payment Amount shall be the same for each period, and include both an interest\nportion and a principal portion.

The loan details are as follows: \n    • The loan duration can be for any number of months up to 72 months.\n    • Drawdowns occur as a single drawdown for the full balance at the beginning of the loan.\n    • The drawdown can occur on any Business Day. A Business Day is defined as a weekday\n    (Monday to Friday) that is not a Holiday. The list of Holidays has been provided to you.\n    • The Actual Payment Date shall be based on the Regular Payment Date, but adjusted to be a\n    Business Day as described below.\n    • Loan payments are made monthly in arrears, on the Actual Payment Date each month, with the\n    first payment one month after drawdown.\n    • The Regular Payment Date each month will be the same DAY of the month as the loan drawdown\n    (for example, if the drawdown was the 8th of October, then the Regular Payment Date will be the\n    8th of each month).\n    • The Actual Payment Date will equal the Regular Payment Date, subject to the following three\n    conditions:\n \nHINT: For Questions 1-4, you can ignore conditions 2 and 3, as they will not be relevant. \n \nCondition 1:  If the Regular Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the Actual Payment \nDate will be made on the first Business Day after the regular payment date, \nexcept where that Business Day would be in a new calendar month. \n \nHINT: For Questions 5-8, your model will need to also incorporate conditions 2 and 3. \n \nCondition 2: \nIf Condition 1 results in a new calendar month, the Actual Payment Date shall be \nthe last Business Day of the calendar month (which, by definition, will be before \nthe Regular Payment Date) \nCondition 3: \nIf the Regular Payment Date is the 29th, 30th or 31st of the month then, where a \nmonth has fewer days (e.g. February), the Actual Payment Date will be the last \nBusiness Day of the calendar month. \n \n• The Monthly Payment Amount shall be the same for each period, and include both an interest\nportion and a principal portion. Therefore, the split between interest and principal will change from \nperiod to period. \n• Interest due shall be calculated on an Actual / 365 basis based on the number of days between\nsuccessive Actual Payment Dates. \n• Do not round any of your calculations.\n \nYour manager has also given you the following advice for preparing your model: \n• It is expected you will need to use Excel’s Goal Seek tool or equivalent functionality in order to\nfind the Monthly Payment Amount.  Due to the interest periods having a different number of days \nfrom month to month, you will not be able to solve this problem with the PMT, PPMT or IPMT \nfunctions.\n\nHOLIDAY SCHEDULE \n \nYour model should accommodate the following fixed schedule of holidays. \n \nA list of these Holidays is included in the provided workbook. \n \n3 April 2015 \n6 April 2015 \n25 October 2015 \n25 March 2016 \n28 March 2016 \n24 October 2016 \n14 April 2017 \n17 April 2017 \n30 October 2017 \n30 March 2018 \n2 April 2018 \n19 October 2018 \n19 April 2019 \n22 April 2019 \n14 October 2019 \n10 April 2020 \n13 April 2020 \n19 October 2020 \n \nHINT: It may be convenient to construct a static list next to the Holiday List, either through \nformulas or manual entry, of the Actual Payment Date that corresponds to each Holiday. \n \nQuestions 1-4 relate to Loan 1 with the following terms: \nLoan amount: $250,000 \nLoan duration: 72 months \nDrawdown date: 19 January 2015 \nInterest Rate: 5.20% per annum \n \nQuestions 5-8 relate to Loan 2 with the following terms: \nLoan amount: $100,000 \nLoan duration: 48 months \nDrawdown date: 30 June 2015 \nInterest Rate: 7.00% per annum\n\nQuestion 3 For Loan 1, the Monthly Payment Amount ends in what number of cents (rounded to the nearest cent)?  a. 85 b. 47 c. 32 d. 11

The loan details are as follows: \n    • The loan duration can be for any number of months up to 72 months.\n    • Drawdowns occur as a single drawdown for the full balance at the beginning of the loan.\n    • The drawdown can occur on any Business Day. A Business Day is defined as a weekday\n    (Monday to Friday) that is not a Holiday. The list of Holidays has been provided to you.\n    • The Actual Payment Date shall be based on the Regular Payment Date, but adjusted to be a\n    Business Day as described below.\n    • Loan payments are made monthly in arrears, on the Actual Payment Date each month, with the\n    first payment one month after drawdown.\n    • The Regular Payment Date each month will be the same DAY of the month as the loan drawdown\n    (for example, if the drawdown was the 8th of October, then the Regular Payment Date will be the\n    8th of each month).\n    • The Actual Payment Date will equal the Regular Payment Date, subject to the following three\n    conditions:\n \nHINT: For Questions 1-4, you can ignore conditions 2 and 3, as they will not be relevant. \n \nCondition 1:  If the Regular Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the Actual Payment \nDate will be made on the first Business Day after the regular payment date, \nexcept where that Business Day would be in a new calendar month. \n \nHINT: For Questions 5-8, your model will need to also incorporate conditions 2 and 3. \n \nCondition 2: \nIf Condition 1 results in a new calendar month, the Actual Payment Date shall be \nthe last Business Day of the calendar month (which, by definition, will be before \nthe Regular Payment Date) \nCondition 3: \nIf the Regular Payment Date is the 29th, 30th or 31st of the month then, where a \nmonth has fewer days (e.g. February), the Actual Payment Date will be the last \nBusiness Day of the calendar month. \n \n• The Monthly Payment Amount shall be the same for each period, and include both an interest\nportion and a principal portion. Therefore, the split between interest and principal will change from \nperiod to period. \n• Interest due shall be calculated on an Actual / 365 basis based on the number of days between\nsuccessive Actual Payment Dates. \n• Do not round any of your calculations.\n \nYour manager has also given you the following advice for preparing your model: \n• It is expected you will need to use Excel’s Goal Seek tool or equivalent functionality in order to\nfind the Monthly Payment Amount.  Due to the interest periods having a different number of days \nfrom month to month, you will not be able to solve this problem with the PMT, PPMT or IPMT \nfunctions.\n\nHOLIDAY SCHEDULE \n \nYour model should accommodate the following fixed schedule of holidays. \n \nA list of these Holidays is included in the provided workbook. \n \n3 April 2015 \n6 April 2015 \n25 October 2015 \n25 March 2016 \n28 March 2016 \n24 October 2016 \n14 April 2017 \n17 April 2017 \n30 October 2017 \n30 March 2018 \n2 April 2018 \n19 October 2018 \n19 April 2019 \n22 April 2019 \n14 October 2019 \n10 April 2020 \n13 April 2020 \n19 October 2020 \n \nHINT: It may be convenient to construct a static list next to the Holiday List, either through \nformulas or manual entry, of the Actual Payment Date that corresponds to each Holiday. \n \nQuestions 1-4 relate to Loan 1 with the following terms: \nLoan amount: $250,000 \nLoan duration: 72 months \nDrawdown date: 19 January 2015 \nInterest Rate: 5.20% per annum \n \nQuestions 5-8 relate to Loan 2 with the following terms: \nLoan amount: $100,000 \nLoan duration: 48 months \nDrawdown date: 30 June 2015 \nInterest Rate: 7.00% per annum\n\nQuestion 4 For Loan 1, after how many payments does the outstanding loan balance first drop below 40% of the original drawdown value?  a. 44 b. 45 c. 46 d. 47

The loan details are as follows: \n    • The loan duration can be for any number of months up to 72 months.\n    • Drawdowns occur as a single drawdown for the full balance at the beginning of the loan.\n    • The drawdown can occur on any Business Day. A Business Day is defined as a weekday\n    (Monday to Friday) that is not a Holiday. The list of Holidays has been provided to you.\n    • The Actual Payment Date shall be based on the Regular Payment Date, but adjusted to be a\n    Business Day as described below.\n    • Loan payments are made monthly in arrears, on the Actual Payment Date each month, with the\n    first payment one month after drawdown.\n    • The Regular Payment Date each month will be the same DAY of the month as the loan drawdown\n    (for example, if the drawdown was the 8th of October, then the Regular Payment Date will be the\n    8th of each month).\n    • The Actual Payment Date will equal the Regular Payment Date, subject to the following three\n    conditions:\n \nHINT: For Questions 1-4, you can ignore conditions 2 and 3, as they will not be relevant. \n \nCondition 1:  If the Regular Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the Actual Payment \nDate will be made on the first Business Day after the regular payment date, \nexcept where that Business Day would be in a new calendar month. \n \nHINT: For Questions 5-8, your model will need to also incorporate conditions 2 and 3. \n \nCondition 2: \nIf Condition 1 results in a new calendar month, the Actual Payment Date shall be \nthe last Business Day of the calendar month (which, by definition, will be before \nthe Regular Payment Date) \nCondition 3: \nIf the Regular Payment Date is the 29th, 30th or 31st of the month then, where a \nmonth has fewer days (e.g. February), the Actual Payment Date will be the last \nBusiness Day of the calendar month. \n \n• The Monthly Payment Amount shall be the same for each period, and include both an interest\nportion and a principal portion. Therefore, the split between interest and principal will change from \nperiod to period. \n• Interest due shall be calculated on an Actual / 365 basis based on the number of days between\nsuccessive Actual Payment Dates. \n• Do not round any of your calculations.\n \nYour manager has also given you the following advice for preparing your model: \n• It is expected you will need to use Excel’s Goal Seek tool or equivalent functionality in order to\nfind the Monthly Payment Amount.  Due to the interest periods having a different number of days \nfrom month to month, you will not be able to solve this problem with the PMT, PPMT or IPMT \nfunctions.\n\nHOLIDAY SCHEDULE \n \nYour model should accommodate the following fixed schedule of holidays. \n \nA list of these Holidays is included in the provided workbook. \n \n3 April 2015 \n6 April 2015 \n25 October 2015 \n25 March 2016 \n28 March 2016 \n24 October 2016 \n14 April 2017 \n17 April 2017 \n30 October 2017 \n30 March 2018 \n2 April 2018 \n19 October 2018 \n19 April 2019 \n22 April 2019 \n14 October 2019 \n10 April 2020 \n13 April 2020 \n19 October 2020 \n \nHINT: It may be convenient to construct a static list next to the Holiday List, either through \nformulas or manual entry, of the Actual Payment Date that corresponds to each Holiday. \n \nQuestions 1-4 relate to Loan 1 with the following terms: \nLoan amount: $250,000 \nLoan duration: 72 months \nDrawdown date: 19 January 2015 \nInterest Rate: 5.20% per annum \n \nQuestions 5-8 relate to Loan 2 with the following terms: \nLoan amount: $100,000 \nLoan duration: 48 months \nDrawdown date: 30 June 2015 \nInterest Rate: 7.00% per annum\n\nQuestion 5 For Loan 2, how many interest periods have exactly 31 days?  a. 12 b. 13 c. 14 d. 15

The loan details are as follows: \n    • The loan duration can be for any number of months up to 72 months.\n    • Drawdowns occur as a single drawdown for the full balance at the beginning of the loan.\n    • The drawdown can occur on any Business Day. A Business Day is defined as a weekday\n    (Monday to Friday) that is not a Holiday. The list of Holidays has been provided to you.\n    • The Actual Payment Date shall be based on the Regular Payment Date, but adjusted to be a\n    Business Day as described below.\n    • Loan payments are made monthly in arrears, on the Actual Payment Date each month, with the\n    first payment one month after drawdown.\n    • The Regular Payment Date each month will be the same DAY of the month as the loan drawdown\n    (for example, if the drawdown was the 8th of October, then the Regular Payment Date will be the\n    8th of each month).\n    • The Actual Payment Date will equal the Regular Payment Date, subject to the following three\n    conditions:\n \nHINT: For Questions 1-4, you can ignore conditions 2 and 3, as they will not be relevant. \n \nCondition 1:  If the Regular Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the Actual Payment \nDate will be made on the first Business Day after the regular payment date, \nexcept where that Business Day would be in a new calendar month. \n \nHINT: For Questions 5-8, your model will need to also incorporate conditions 2 and 3. \n \nCondition 2: \nIf Condition 1 results in a new calendar month, the Actual Payment Date shall be \nthe last Business Day of the calendar month (which, by definition, will be before \nthe Regular Payment Date) \nCondition 3: \nIf the Regular Payment Date is the 29th, 30th or 31st of the month then, where a \nmonth has fewer days (e.g. February), the Actual Payment Date will be the last \nBusiness Day of the calendar month. \n \n• The Monthly Payment Amount shall be the same for each period, and include both an interest\nportion and a principal portion. Therefore, the split between interest and principal will change from \nperiod to period. \n• Interest due shall be calculated on an Actual / 365 basis based on the number of days between\nsuccessive Actual Payment Dates. \n• Do not round any of your calculations.\n \nYour manager has also given you the following advice for preparing your model: \n• It is expected you will need to use Excel’s Goal Seek tool or equivalent functionality in order to\nfind the Monthly Payment Amount.  Due to the interest periods having a different number of days \nfrom month to month, you will not be able to solve this problem with the PMT, PPMT or IPMT \nfunctions.\n\nHOLIDAY SCHEDULE \n \nYour model should accommodate the following fixed schedule of holidays. \n \nA list of these Holidays is included in the provided workbook. \n \n3 April 2015 \n6 April 2015 \n25 October 2015 \n25 March 2016 \n28 March 2016 \n24 October 2016 \n14 April 2017 \n17 April 2017 \n30 October 2017 \n30 March 2018 \n2 April 2018 \n19 October 2018 \n19 April 2019 \n22 April 2019 \n14 October 2019 \n10 April 2020 \n13 April 2020 \n19 October 2020 \n \nHINT: It may be convenient to construct a static list next to the Holiday List, either through \nformulas or manual entry, of the Actual Payment Date that corresponds to each Holiday. \n \nQuestions 1-4 relate to Loan 1 with the following terms: \nLoan amount: $250,000 \nLoan duration: 72 months \nDrawdown date: 19 January 2015 \nInterest Rate: 5.20% per annum \n \nQuestions 5-8 relate to Loan 2 with the following terms: \nLoan amount: $100,000 \nLoan duration: 48 months \nDrawdown date: 30 June 2015 \nInterest Rate: 7.00% per annum\n\nQuestion 6 For Loan 2, the Monthly Payment Amount is:  a. $2,394.62 b. $2,394.98 c. $2,395.14 d. $2,395.40

The loan details are as follows: \n    • The loan duration can be for any number of months up to 72 months.\n    • Drawdowns occur as a single drawdown for the full balance at the beginning of the loan.\n    • The drawdown can occur on any Business Day. A Business Day is defined as a weekday\n    (Monday to Friday) that is not a Holiday. The list of Holidays has been provided to you.\n    • The Actual Payment Date shall be based on the Regular Payment Date, but adjusted to be a\n    Business Day as described below.\n    • Loan payments are made monthly in arrears, on the Actual Payment Date each month, with the\n    first payment one month after drawdown.\n    • The Regular Payment Date each month will be the same DAY of the month as the loan drawdown\n    (for example, if the drawdown was the 8th of October, then the Regular Payment Date will be the\n    8th of each month).\n    • The Actual Payment Date will equal the Regular Payment Date, subject to the following three\n    conditions:\n \nHINT: For Questions 1-4, you can ignore conditions 2 and 3, as they will not be relevant. \n \nCondition 1:  If the Regular Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the Actual Payment \nDate will be made on the first Business Day after the regular payment date, \nexcept where that Business Day would be in a new calendar month. \n \nHINT: For Questions 5-8, your model will need to also incorporate conditions 2 and 3. \n \nCondition 2: \nIf Condition 1 results in a new calendar month, the Actual Payment Date shall be \nthe last Business Day of the calendar month (which, by definition, will be before \nthe Regular Payment Date) \nCondition 3: \nIf the Regular Payment Date is the 29th, 30th or 31st of the month then, where a \nmonth has fewer days (e.g. February), the Actual Payment Date will be the last \nBusiness Day of the calendar month. \n \n• The Monthly Payment Amount shall be the same for each period, and include both an interest\nportion and a principal portion. Therefore, the split between interest and principal will change from \nperiod to period. \n• Interest due shall be calculated on an Actual / 365 basis based on the number of days between\nsuccessive Actual Payment Dates. \n• Do not round any of your calculations.\n \nYour manager has also given you the following advice for preparing your model: \n• It is expected you will need to use Excel’s Goal Seek tool or equivalent functionality in order to\nfind the Monthly Payment Amount.  Due to the interest periods having a different number of days \nfrom month to month, you will not be able to solve this problem with the PMT, PPMT or IPMT \nfunctions.\n\nHOLIDAY SCHEDULE \n \nYour model should accommodate the following fixed schedule of holidays. \n \nA list of these Holidays is included in the provided workbook. \n \n3 April 2015 \n6 April 2015 \n25 October 2015 \n25 March 2016 \n28 March 2016 \n24 October 2016 \n14 April 2017 \n17 April 2017 \n30 October 2017 \n30 March 2018 \n2 April 2018 \n19 October 2018 \n19 April 2019 \n22 April 2019 \n14 October 2019 \n10 April 2020 \n13 April 2020 \n19 October 2020 \n \nHINT: It may be convenient to construct a static list next to the Holiday List, either through \nformulas or manual entry, of the Actual Payment Date that corresponds to each Holiday. \n \nQuestions 1-4 relate to Loan 1 with the following terms: \nLoan amount: $250,000 \nLoan duration: 72 months \nDrawdown date: 19 January 2015 \nInterest Rate: 5.20% per annum \n \nQuestions 5-8 relate to Loan 2 with the following terms: \nLoan amount: $100,000 \nLoan duration: 48 months \nDrawdown date: 30 June 2015 \nInterest Rate: 7.00% per annum\n\nQuestion 7 For Loan 2, the loan balance immediately after the 12th payment on 30 June 2016 is:  a. $77,566.02 b. $77,566.34 c. $77,566.87 d. $77,567.31

The loan details are as follows: \n    • The loan duration can be for any number of months up to 72 months.\n    • Drawdowns occur as a single drawdown for the full balance at the beginning of the loan.\n    • The drawdown can occur on any Business Day. A Business Day is defined as a weekday\n    (Monday to Friday) that is not a Holiday. The list of Holidays has been provided to you.\n    • The Actual Payment Date shall be based on the Regular Payment Date, but adjusted to be a\n    Business Day as described below.\n    • Loan payments are made monthly in arrears, on the Actual Payment Date each month, with the\n    first payment one month after drawdown.\n    • The Regular Payment Date each month will be the same DAY of the month as the loan drawdown\n    (for example, if the drawdown was the 8th of October, then the Regular Payment Date will be the\n    8th of each month).\n    • The Actual Payment Date will equal the Regular Payment Date, subject to the following three\n    conditions:\n \nHINT: For Questions 1-4, you can ignore conditions 2 and 3, as they will not be relevant. \n \nCondition 1:  If the Regular Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the Actual Payment \nDate will be made on the first Business Day after the regular payment date, \nexcept where that Business Day would be in a new calendar month. \n \nHINT: For Questions 5-8, your model will need to also incorporate conditions 2 and 3. \n \nCondition 2: \nIf Condition 1 results in a new calendar month, the Actual Payment Date shall be \nthe last Business Day of the calendar month (which, by definition, will be before \nthe Regular Payment Date) \nCondition 3: \nIf the Regular Payment Date is the 29th, 30th or 31st of the month then, where a \nmonth has fewer days (e.g. February), the Actual Payment Date will be the last \nBusiness Day of the calendar month. \n \n• The Monthly Payment Amount shall be the same for each period, and include both an interest\nportion and a principal portion. Therefore, the split between interest and principal will change from \nperiod to period. \n• Interest due shall be calculated on an Actual / 365 basis based on the number of days between\nsuccessive Actual Payment Dates. \n• Do not round any of your calculations.\n \nYour manager has also given you the following advice for preparing your model: \n• It is expected you will need to use Excel’s Goal Seek tool or equivalent functionality in order to\nfind the Monthly Payment Amount.  Due to the interest periods having a different number of days \nfrom month to month, you will not be able to solve this problem with the PMT, PPMT or IPMT \nfunctions.\n\nHOLIDAY SCHEDULE \n \nYour model should accommodate the following fixed schedule of holidays. \n \nA list of these Holidays is included in the provided workbook. \n \n3 April 2015 \n6 April 2015 \n25 October 2015 \n25 March 2016 \n28 March 2016 \n24 October 2016 \n14 April 2017 \n17 April 2017 \n30 October 2017 \n30 March 2018 \n2 April 2018 \n19 October 2018 \n19 April 2019 \n22 April 2019 \n14 October 2019 \n10 April 2020 \n13 April 2020 \n19 October 2020 \n \nHINT: It may be convenient to construct a static list next to the Holiday List, either through \nformulas or manual entry, of the Actual Payment Date that corresponds to each Holiday. \n \nQuestions 1-4 relate to Loan 1 with the following terms: \nLoan amount: $250,000 \nLoan duration: 72 months \nDrawdown date: 19 January 2015 \nInterest Rate: 5.20% per annum \n \nQuestions 5-8 relate to Loan 2 with the following terms: \nLoan amount: $100,000 \nLoan duration: 48 months \nDrawdown date: 30 June 2015 \nInterest Rate: 7.00% per annum\n\nQuestion 8 For Loan 2, what proportion of total payments made over the life of the loan are interest payments, rounded to the nearest percent?

INTRODUCTION\nYou are working as a business analyst at a leading hardware retailer. You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 1 Over the entire analysis period, what was the quantity of item 10 sold while John Jones was the Manager on duty?

      DSBench/data/00000034, INTRODUCTION\nYou are working as a business analyst at a leading hardware retailer. You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 2 Over the entire analysis period, what were the 3 highest selling items by quantity?  a. 8, 17, 40 b. 4, 11, 49 c. 6, 17, 18 d. 7, 11, 33

analyst at a leading hardware retailer. You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 3 Over the entire analysis period, which sales person sold the highest cumulative quantity of a single item, and which item was it?  a.

DSBench/data/00000034, INTRODUCTION\nYou are working as a business analyst at a leading hardware retailer. You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 4 What was sales person Wendel’s total Sales over the analysis period?

You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 5 How many invoices did sales person Sally create over the analysis period?  a. 723 b. 985 c. 318 d. 650

You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 6 During the month of May, which postal code bought the most of item 5 by quantity?  a. 3011 b. 3014 c. 3029 d. 3032

You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 7 During the month of February, how many postal codes bought more than 400 products by quantity? a. 3 b. 4 c. 5 d. 6            \n

      DSBench/data/00000034, INTRODUCTION\nYou are working as a business analyst at a leading hardware retailer. You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 8 Over the entire dataset, which 3 items did Postcode 3020 spend the greatest dollars on?  a. 6, 9, 46 b. 3, 6, 9 c. 7, 20, 28 d. 6, 9, 44

You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 9 What is the rank of sales persons from highest to lowest based on the number of invoices written during the month of May?  a.

DSBench/data/00000034, INTRODUCTION\nYou are working as a business analyst at a leading hardware retailer. You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 10 What was the invoice number of the largest invoice by revenue that sales person Wendel wrote during the analysis period?  a. 143 b. 2166 c. 3269 d. 3327

                            DSBench/data/00000034, INTRODUCTION\nYou are working as a business analyst at a leading hardware retailer. You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 11 Over the entire analysis period, what is the rank of sales persons according to the dollar value of discounts given, from most discounts to least discounts?  a.

You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 12 Which month had the highest revenue?  a. March b. April c. May d. June

DSBench/data/00000034, INTRODUCTION\nYou are working as a business analyst at a leading hardware retailer. You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 13 Only considering postal codes 3013, 3017 and 3031, which item had the highest total profit during the month of February?  a. 3 b. 6 c. 17 d. 44

You have been asked to assist with \nthe analysis of some recent sales data from one of your hardware stores. \n \nDATA STRUCTURE \nThe data covers the first 6 months of the year 2013 and has a line for each different item type sold on \neach invoice. One or more lines may be associated with a single invoice. \n \nNote that each line also has a quantity field that represents the quantity of that particular item type sold on \nthat invoice. \n  \nEach invoice is associated with one Manager on Duty and one Sales Assistant. \n \nRECOMMENDED APPROACH  \nThe format of the data and the questions you will need to answer very strongly lends itself to doing the \nanalysis with the aid of a PivotTable. You may also benefit from adding some extra calculation columns to \nthe table of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nQUESTION 16 What quantity of item 3 was sold by sales persons Benny and Kelly together during the month of June?  a. 9 b. 116 c. 134 d. 475

Fair Value and Market value mean the same thing? a. No, Fair Value may include some other value to a buyer that the open market does not recognise thereby making Fair Value greater than Market Value in some cases b. No, Fair Value comes into play before an active market is identified and as such will almost always be less than what can be achieved at market c. Yes, Fair Value is ultimately the same as Market Value as it is used up until the selling party decides its asking price after which point it is referred to as the asset's asking Market Value d. Yes, Fair Value is the same as Market Value which is ultimately the same as the asset's current replacement value

The business then sells the electricity generated at an agreed price schedule to either \nthe owner of the house or the main electrical grid. \n \nYou will need to calculate forecasts of: \ni) kW of installed capacity\nii) Generation of electricity (in kWh)\niii) Purchasing and installation costs\niv) Revenues from generation.\n \nNote on Energy Industry Terminology: \n“kW” stands for kilowatt, and is a measure of electrical power. \n“kWh” stands for kilowatt-hour, and is a measure of energy, equal to the work done by a power of 1 kW for \none hour. \nFor example, a small electric heater might operate at a power of 2,000 watts or 2kW. In three hours of \noperation, it would consume 2kW x 3 hours = 6kWh of electricity (energy). \n \nAs the business is based in Australia, the costs and revenue forecasts need to be prepared in Australian \nDollars (AUD). \n \nYou are to prepare a monthly forecast model that includes the dates from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2023. \n \nTo assist you in your task, the assumptions page has already been set out for you in the included \nworkbook, but with the operational assumptions missing. You will need to fill in the assumptions, \nand then model the necessary calculations. \n \nOPERATIONAL DETAILS \nPurchasing and installation costs \nThe solar panels are purchased in US Dollars (USD) either as small or large systems. \n \nThe small systems cost US$5,000 and have a rated capacity of 3kW. \nThe large systems cost US$8,000 and have a rated capacity of 5kW. \n \nIn addition to the purchase cost, each system also costs 500 Australian Dollars (AU$500) to install on a \nrooftop. \n \nAssume that costs do not escalate with time. \n \n\nPerformance of panels \nWhen they are new, the panels are forecast to generate 4 kWh of electricity per day per kW of rated \ncapacity.  So for example, a new 3kW system would, in the month of May, generate 4kWh/kW/day * 3kW * \n31 days = 372 kWh of electricity in the month of May. \n \nThe panels degrade over time. When they are brand new (that is, in the month of installation) they operate \nat 100% efficiency. They then decline in efficiency on a diminishing value basis by a constant percentage \namount every month, so that on any given day, the efficiency in 12 months’ time of a panel will be exactly \n99% of its current efficiency. \n \nAssume that the degradation of each panel occurs monthly, instantaneously on the first day of each \nmonth, beginning in the month after installation of that panel. You will need to determine the appropriate \nmonthly degradation rate. \n \nRevenues \nSome of the electricity generated by the panels will be purchased by the house at a price equal to Tariff \nA. The remainder of the electricity generated will be sold to the main electrical grid at a price equal to \nTariff B. \n \nHouses with a small system will purchase 10 kWh of electricity per day from the company at a price equal \nto Tariff A. \nHouses with a large system will purchase 15 kWh of electricity per day from the company at a price equal \nto Tariff A. \n \nPrices \nTariff A: Initial price is AUD $0.2500 per kWh. Each 1 July, beginning on 1 July 2014, the price of Tariff A \nwill escalate by 2%. \n \nTariff B: Initial price is AUD $0.08 per kWh. This tariff does not escalate. \n \nInstallation Details \nThe installation period lasts from July 2013 to June 2015. The number of small and large systems installed \neach month has been provided for you in the included workbook. \n \nAssume that all systems are installed on the first day of the month and begin generation instantly.

The business then sells the electricity generated at an agreed price schedule to either \nthe owner of the house or the main electrical grid. \n \nYou will need to calculate forecasts of: \ni) kW of installed capacity\nii) Generation of electricity (in kWh)\niii) Purchasing and installation costs\niv) Revenues from generation.\n \nNote on Energy Industry Terminology: \n“kW” stands for kilowatt, and is a measure of electrical power. \n“kWh” stands for kilowatt-hour, and is a measure of energy, equal to the work done by a power of 1 kW for \none hour. \nFor example, a small electric heater might operate at a power of 2,000 watts or 2kW. In three hours of \noperation, it would consume 2kW x 3 hours = 6kWh of electricity (energy). \n \nAs the business is based in Australia, the costs and revenue forecasts need to be prepared in Australian \nDollars (AUD). \n \nYou are to prepare a monthly forecast model that includes the dates from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2023. \n \nTo assist you in your task, the assumptions page has already been set out for you in the included \nworkbook, but with the operational assumptions missing. You will need to fill in the assumptions, \nand then model the necessary calculations. \n \nOPERATIONAL DETAILS \nPurchasing and installation costs \nThe solar panels are purchased in US Dollars (USD) either as small or large systems. \n \nThe small systems cost US$5,000 and have a rated capacity of 3kW. \nThe large systems cost US$8,000 and have a rated capacity of 5kW. \n \nIn addition to the purchase cost, each system also costs 500 Australian Dollars (AU$500) to install on a \nrooftop. \n \nAssume that costs do not escalate with time. \n \n\nPerformance of panels \nWhen they are new, the panels are forecast to generate 4 kWh of electricity per day per kW of rated \ncapacity.  So for example, a new 3kW system would, in the month of May, generate 4kWh/kW/day * 3kW * \n31 days = 372 kWh of electricity in the month of May. \n \nThe panels degrade over time. When they are brand new (that is, in the month of installation) they operate \nat 100% efficiency. They then decline in efficiency on a diminishing value basis by a constant percentage \namount every month, so that on any given day, the efficiency in 12 months’ time of a panel will be exactly \n99% of its current efficiency. \n \nAssume that the degradation of each panel occurs monthly, instantaneously on the first day of each \nmonth, beginning in the month after installation of that panel. You will need to determine the appropriate \nmonthly degradation rate. \n \nRevenues \nSome of the electricity generated by the panels will be purchased by the house at a price equal to Tariff \nA. The remainder of the electricity generated will be sold to the main electrical grid at a price equal to \nTariff B. \n \nHouses with a small system will purchase 10 kWh of electricity per day from the company at a price equal \nto Tariff A. \nHouses with a large system will purchase 15 kWh of electricity per day from the company at a price equal \nto Tariff A. \n \nPrices \nTariff A: Initial price is AUD $0.2500 per kWh. Each 1 July, beginning on 1 July 2014, the price of Tariff A \nwill escalate by 2%. \n \nTariff B: Initial price is AUD $0.08 per kWh. This tariff does not escalate. \n \nInstallation Details \nThe installation period lasts from July 2013 to June 2015. The number of small and large systems installed \neach month has been provided for you in the included workbook. \n \nAssume that all systems are installed on the first day of the month and begin generation instantly.

The business then sells the electricity generated at an agreed price schedule to either \nthe owner of the house or the main electrical grid. \n \nYou will need to calculate forecasts of: \ni) kW of installed capacity\nii) Generation of electricity (in kWh)\niii) Purchasing and installation costs\niv) Revenues from generation.\n \nNote on Energy Industry Terminology: \n“kW” stands for kilowatt, and is a measure of electrical power. \n“kWh” stands for kilowatt-hour, and is a measure of energy, equal to the work done by a power of 1 kW for \none hour. \nFor example, a small electric heater might operate at a power of 2,000 watts or 2kW. In three hours of \noperation, it would consume 2kW x 3 hours = 6kWh of electricity (energy). \n \nAs the business is based in Australia, the costs and revenue forecasts need to be prepared in Australian \nDollars (AUD). \n \nYou are to prepare a monthly forecast model that includes the dates from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2023. \n \nTo assist you in your task, the assumptions page has already been set out for you in the included \nworkbook, but with the operational assumptions missing. You will need to fill in the assumptions, \nand then model the necessary calculations. \n \nOPERATIONAL DETAILS \nPurchasing and installation costs \nThe solar panels are purchased in US Dollars (USD) either as small or large systems. \n \nThe small systems cost US$5,000 and have a rated capacity of 3kW. \nThe large systems cost US$8,000 and have a rated capacity of 5kW. \n \nIn addition to the purchase cost, each system also costs 500 Australian Dollars (AU$500) to install on a \nrooftop. \n \nAssume that costs do not escalate with time. \n \n\nPerformance of panels \nWhen they are new, the panels are forecast to generate 4 kWh of electricity per day per kW of rated \ncapacity.  So for example, a new 3kW system would, in the month of May, generate 4kWh/kW/day * 3kW * \n31 days = 372 kWh of electricity in the month of May. \n \nThe panels degrade over time. When they are brand new (that is, in the month of installation) they operate \nat 100% efficiency. They then decline in efficiency on a diminishing value basis by a constant percentage \namount every month, so that on any given day, the efficiency in 12 months’ time of a panel will be exactly \n99% of its current efficiency. \n \nAssume that the degradation of each panel occurs monthly, instantaneously on the first day of each \nmonth, beginning in the month after installation of that panel. You will need to determine the appropriate \nmonthly degradation rate. \n \nRevenues \nSome of the electricity generated by the panels will be purchased by the house at a price equal to Tariff \nA. The remainder of the electricity generated will be sold to the main electrical grid at a price equal to \nTariff B. \n \nHouses with a small system will purchase 10 kWh of electricity per day from the company at a price equal \nto Tariff A. \nHouses with a large system will purchase 15 kWh of electricity per day from the company at a price equal \nto Tariff A. \n \nPrices \nTariff A: Initial price is AUD $0.2500 per kWh. Each 1 July, beginning on 1 July 2014, the price of Tariff A \nwill escalate by 2%. \n \nTariff B: Initial price is AUD $0.08 per kWh. This tariff does not escalate. \n \nInstallation Details \nThe installation period lasts from July 2013 to June 2015.

The business then sells the electricity generated at an agreed price schedule to either \nthe owner of the house or the main electrical grid. \n \nYou will need to calculate forecasts of: \ni) kW of installed capacity\nii) Generation of electricity (in kWh)\niii) Purchasing and installation costs\niv) Revenues from generation.\n \nNote on Energy Industry Terminology: \n“kW” stands for kilowatt, and is a measure of electrical power. \n“kWh” stands for kilowatt-hour, and is a measure of energy, equal to the work done by a power of 1 kW for \none hour. \nFor example, a small electric heater might operate at a power of 2,000 watts or 2kW. In three hours of \noperation, it would consume 2kW x 3 hours = 6kWh of electricity (energy). \n \nAs the business is based in Australia, the costs and revenue forecasts need to be prepared in Australian \nDollars (AUD). \n \nYou are to prepare a monthly forecast model that includes the dates from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2023. \n \nTo assist you in your task, the assumptions page has already been set out for you in the included \nworkbook, but with the operational assumptions missing. You will need to fill in the assumptions, \nand then model the necessary calculations. \n \nOPERATIONAL DETAILS \nPurchasing and installation costs \nThe solar panels are purchased in US Dollars (USD) either as small or large systems. \n \nThe small systems cost US$5,000 and have a rated capacity of 3kW. \nThe large systems cost US$8,000 and have a rated capacity of 5kW. \n \nIn addition to the purchase cost, each system also costs 500 Australian Dollars (AU$500) to install on a \nrooftop. \n \nAssume that costs do not escalate with time. \n \n\nPerformance of panels \nWhen they are new, the panels are forecast to generate 4 kWh of electricity per day per kW of rated \ncapacity.  So for example, a new 3kW system would, in the month of May, generate 4kWh/kW/day * 3kW * \n31 days = 372 kWh of electricity in the month of May. \n \nThe panels degrade over time. When they are brand new (that is, in the month of installation) they operate \nat 100% efficiency. They then decline in efficiency on a diminishing value basis by a constant percentage \namount every month, so that on any given day, the efficiency in 12 months’ time of a panel will be exactly \n99% of its current efficiency. \n \nAssume that the degradation of each panel occurs monthly, instantaneously on the first day of each \nmonth, beginning in the month after installation of that panel. You will need to determine the appropriate \nmonthly degradation rate. \n \nRevenues \nSome of the electricity generated by the panels will be purchased by the house at a price equal to Tariff \nA. The remainder of the electricity generated will be sold to the main electrical grid at a price equal to \nTariff B. \n \nHouses with a small system will purchase 10 kWh of electricity per day from the company at a price equal \nto Tariff A. \nHouses with a large system will purchase 15 kWh of electricity per day from the company at a price equal \nto Tariff A. \n \nPrices \nTariff A: Initial price is AUD $0.2500 per kWh. Each 1 July, beginning on 1 July 2014, the price of Tariff A \nwill escalate by 2%. \n \nTariff B: Initial price is AUD $0.08 per kWh. This tariff does not escalate. \n \nInstallation Details \nThe installation period lasts from July 2013 to June 2015.

The business then sells the electricity generated at an agreed price schedule to either \nthe owner of the house or the main electrical grid. \n \nYou will need to calculate forecasts of: \ni) kW of installed capacity\nii) Generation of electricity (in kWh)\niii) Purchasing and installation costs\niv) Revenues from generation.\n \nNote on Energy Industry Terminology: \n“kW” stands for kilowatt, and is a measure of electrical power. \n“kWh” stands for kilowatt-hour, and is a measure of energy, equal to the work done by a power of 1 kW for \none hour. \nFor example, a small electric heater might operate at a power of 2,000 watts or 2kW. In three hours of \noperation, it would consume 2kW x 3 hours = 6kWh of electricity (energy). \n \nAs the business is based in Australia, the costs and revenue forecasts need to be prepared in Australian \nDollars (AUD). \n \nYou are to prepare a monthly forecast model that includes the dates from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2023. \n \nTo assist you in your task, the assumptions page has already been set out for you in the included \nworkbook, but with the operational assumptions missing. You will need to fill in the assumptions, \nand then model the necessary calculations. \n \nOPERATIONAL DETAILS \nPurchasing and installation costs \nThe solar panels are purchased in US Dollars (USD) either as small or large systems. \n \nThe small systems cost US$5,000 and have a rated capacity of 3kW. \nThe large systems cost US$8,000 and have a rated capacity of 5kW. \n \nIn addition to the purchase cost, each system also costs 500 Australian Dollars (AU$500) to install on a \nrooftop. \n \nAssume that costs do not escalate with time. \n \n\nPerformance of panels \nWhen they are new, the panels are forecast to generate 4 kWh of electricity per day per kW of rated \ncapacity.  So for example, a new 3kW system would, in the month of May, generate 4kWh/kW/day * 3kW * \n31 days = 372 kWh of electricity in the month of May. \n \nThe panels degrade over time. When they are brand new (that is, in the month of installation) they operate \nat 100% efficiency. They then decline in efficiency on a diminishing value basis by a constant percentage \namount every month, so that on any given day, the efficiency in 12 months’ time of a panel will be exactly \n99% of its current efficiency. \n \nAssume that the degradation of each panel occurs monthly, instantaneously on the first day of each \nmonth, beginning in the month after installation of that panel. You will need to determine the appropriate \nmonthly degradation rate. \n \nRevenues \nSome of the electricity generated by the panels will be purchased by the house at a price equal to Tariff \nA. The remainder of the electricity generated will be sold to the main electrical grid at a price equal to \nTariff B. \n \nHouses with a small system will purchase 10 kWh of electricity per day from the company at a price equal \nto Tariff A. \nHouses with a large system will purchase 15 kWh of electricity per day from the company at a price equal \nto Tariff A. \n \nPrices \nTariff A: Initial price is AUD $0.2500 per kWh. Each 1 July, beginning on 1 July 2014, the price of Tariff A \nwill escalate by 2%. \n \nTariff B: Initial price is AUD $0.08 per kWh. This tariff does not escalate. \n \nInstallation Details \nThe installation period lasts from July 2013 to June 2015. The number of small and large systems installed \neach month has been provided for you in the included workbook. \n \nAssume that all systems are installed on the first day of the month and begin generation instantly.

The facility is only drawn when it is needed to \nfinance the purchasing of an asset in to the fund, and each asset purchased will map to its own tranche in \nthe facility. \n \nTRANCHE DETAILS \nThe facility is forecast to have 4 tranches. Details of each tranche are given in the table over page. \n \nINTEREST BASIS AND TIMING ASSUMPTIONS \nAssume that all interest is calculated on a 30/360 basis on the opening daily balance.  All interest rates \ngiven are simple annual rates (not effective-annual compounding rates).

The facility is only drawn when it is needed to \nfinance the purchasing of an asset in to the fund, and each asset purchased will map to its own tranche in \nthe facility. \n \nTRANCHE DETAILS \nThe facility is forecast to have 4 tranches.

and rent it out to take advantage of \nSan Francisco’s thriving rental market! \nIncome and Expense  \nAs a result of the investment going into the area, you hope to sell the apartment in the next 10 years for \ndouble what you paid for it. For the purposes of this model, assume that the property value will grow at a \nconstant % per annum with growth compounding. Further assumptions are as follows: \n Rental income is estimated to be $83,200 per annum\n Agency fees will be 9% of rent per annum\n Rental income will increase annually by 2% in the first two years and by 5% thereafter.\nYou also estimate you will have to spend at least 5% of rental income per annum maintaining the property, \nand you have set a budget of $10,000 to furnish the apartment prior to renting it. \nBorrowing \nABC bank has offered you a 25 year mortgage with:  \n A fixed interest rate of 5% on the outstanding principle for the duration of the loan.\n A bank charge of a $10,000 arrangement fee.\n A maximum loan of $900,000\nThe loan allows early repayment of principal and you intend to use all free cash flow to pay down principal \nat the end of each year. You will contribute the remaining funds required to complete the purchase. \nTax  \n Rental income is taxable\n Interest expense, letting agent fees and maintenance expenses are all tax deductible.\n Assume a tax rate of 35% for your analysis and that tax is paid promptly at year end.\nWhen you sell the property, capital gains tax will be payable. To calculate your capital gain on sale, \ncompare your total purchase price (which will include the house purchase price, mortgage fees, and \nfurniture cost) to the sale price. The difference is the capital gain on the property. Assume a capital gains \ntax rate of 20%. \nThe Model \nYou have decided to build a financial model of this situation for number of reasons. Firstly, the bank has \noffered you the mortgage based on the condition that you provide them with a yearly rental income cash \nflow forecast. They want to ensure that the apartment will generate enough rental income to comfortably \nservice the mortgage.  \nYou also want to use the financial model to calculate the estimated return on your investment and to \ncalculate the best time to exit your investment to maximise your IRR. \n \n\nQuestion 3  What is the expected Internal Rate of Return (IRR) if the property is sold at the end of the 10 years?  a. 9.2%    b. 10.2%    c. 11.2%    d. 12.2%

\nSan Francisco’s thriving rental market! \nIncome and Expense  \nAs a result of the investment going into the area, you hope to sell the apartment in the next 10 years for \ndouble what you paid for it. For the purposes of this model, assume that the property value will grow at a \nconstant % per annum with growth compounding. Further assumptions are as follows: \n Rental income is estimated to be $83,200 per annum\n Agency fees will be 9% of rent per annum\n Rental income will increase annually by 2% in the first two years and by 5% thereafter.\nYou also estimate you will have to spend at least 5% of rental income per annum maintaining the property, \nand you have set a budget of $10,000 to furnish the apartment prior to renting it. \nBorrowing \nABC bank has offered you a 25 year mortgage with:  \n A fixed interest rate of 5% on the outstanding principle for the duration of the loan.\n A bank charge of a $10,000 arrangement fee.\n A maximum loan of $900,000\nThe loan allows early repayment of principal and you intend to use all free cash flow to pay down principal \nat the end of each year. You will contribute the remaining funds required to complete the purchase. \nTax  \n Rental income is taxable\n Interest expense, letting agent fees and maintenance expenses are all tax deductible.\n Assume a tax rate of 35% for your analysis and that tax is paid promptly at year end.\nWhen you sell the property, capital gains tax will be payable. To calculate your capital gain on sale, \ncompare your total purchase price (which will include the house purchase price, mortgage fees, and \nfurniture cost) to the sale price. The difference is the capital gain on the property. Assume a capital gains \ntax rate of 20%. \nThe Model \nYou have decided to build a financial model of this situation for number of reasons. Firstly, the bank has \noffered you the mortgage based on the condition that you provide them with a yearly rental income cash \nflow forecast. They want to ensure that the apartment will generate enough rental income to comfortably \nservice the mortgage.  \nYou also want to use the financial model to calculate the estimated return on your investment and to \ncalculate the best time to exit your investment to maximise your IRR. \n \n\nQuestion 4 If the apartment was sold after 2 years, what is the expected proceeds returned after satisfying CGT and repaying any outstanding debt?   a. $930,341    b. $930,343    c. $930,345    d. $930,347

to buy an apartment in Saratoga for US$1,600,000 and rent it out to take advantage of \nSan Francisco’s thriving rental market! \nIncome and Expense  \nAs a result of the investment going into the area, you hope to sell the apartment in the next 10 years for \ndouble what you paid for it. For the purposes of this model, assume that the property value will grow at a \nconstant % per annum with growth compounding. Further assumptions are as follows: \n Rental income is estimated to be $83,200 per annum\n Agency fees will be 9% of rent per annum\n Rental income will increase annually by 2% in the first two years and by 5% thereafter.\nYou also estimate you will have to spend at least 5% of rental income per annum maintaining the property, \nand you have set a budget of $10,000 to furnish the apartment prior to renting it. \nBorrowing \nABC bank has offered you a 25 year mortgage with:  \n A fixed interest rate of 5% on the outstanding principle for the duration of the loan.\n A bank charge of a $10,000 arrangement fee.\n A maximum loan of $900,000\nThe loan allows early repayment of principal and you intend to use all free cash flow to pay down principal \nat the end of each year. You will contribute the remaining funds required to complete the purchase. \nTax  \n Rental income is taxable\n Interest expense, letting agent fees and maintenance expenses are all tax deductible.\n Assume a tax rate of 35% for your analysis and that tax is paid promptly at year end.\nWhen you sell the property, capital gains tax will be payable. To calculate your capital gain on sale, \ncompare your total purchase price (which will include the house purchase price, mortgage fees, and \nfurniture cost) to the sale price. The difference is the capital gain on the property. Assume a capital gains \ntax rate of 20%. \nThe Model \nYou have decided to build a financial model of this situation for number of reasons. Firstly, the bank has \noffered you the mortgage based on the condition that you provide them with a yearly rental income cash \nflow forecast. They want to ensure that the apartment will generate enough rental income to comfortably \nservice the mortgage.  \nYou also want to use the financial model to calculate the estimated return on your investment and to \ncalculate the best time to exit your investment to maximise your IRR. \n \n\nQuestion 5   The highest IRR achieved is by exiting in which year?  a. Year 2    b. Year 5    c. Year 6    d. Year 8

                       DSBench/data/00000043, INTRODUCTION \nUse the Excel spreadsheet that you have downloaded to answer the questions in this Section. Please \nnote, there are deliberate errors in this model for you to identify. These may be in the form of: \n! Circulars\n! Dragging errors\n! Incorrect links\n! Illogical formulas\n! Incomplete formulas\n! etc.\nIMPORTANT  \nFor this section, you are required to progressively fix each error identified as you work through the \nquestions in this section. You will need a correct model to answer the final two questions of this section.  \n\nQuestion 2 A MIN statement has been used at row 14 for the ‘Issuance/(repayment) calculation’ of the Debt worksheet. Should this be in place and why? a. Yes, because the minimum payment should be made to best manage cash reserves  b. Yes, because the maximum payment able to be made is the lower of the balance of the Revolver and the cash available  c. No, because the cash available is the largest possible payment  d. No, it should be as shown, but as a MAX statement instead

Section. Please \nnote, there are deliberate errors in this model for you to identify. These may be in the form of: \n! Circulars\n! Dragging errors\n! Incorrect links\n! Illogical formulas\n! Incomplete formulas\n! etc.\nIMPORTANT  \nFor this section, you are required to progressively fix each error identified as you work through the \nquestions in this section. You will need a correct model to answer the final two questions of this section.  \n\nQuestion 6 Are both the ‘Tax expense’ calculation and the ‘Post tax non-recurring items’ calculation using the right rates?  a. Yes, both use the correct rates  b. No, the ‘Tax expense’ calculation is correct but the ‘Post tax non-recurring items’ calculation is incorrect  c. No, the ‘Post tax non-recurring items’ calculation is correct but the ‘Tax expense’ calculation is incorrect  d. No, both use the incorrect rates
