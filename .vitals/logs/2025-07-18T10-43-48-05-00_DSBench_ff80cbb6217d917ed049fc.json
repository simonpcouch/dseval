You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 6\nHow many days is the plant operational in Q4 2023?\nA. 72\nB. 73\nC. 74\nD. 75\nE. 76\nF. 77\nG. 78\nH. 79\nI. 80",

Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 6\nHow many days is the plant operational in Q4 2023?\nA. 72\nB. 73\nC. 74\nD. 75\nE. 76\nF. 77\nG. 78\nH. 79\nI. 80",

You're working autonomously; do not end your turn until you have a final result. There is no end user to respond to questions you may have.INTRODUCTION\nAll the inputs mentioned below are provided in the workbook for this case study. \nYou are working for a company that is planning to bid for a 20% stake in the cashflows of a biomass plant \nwhich burns wood chip to produce electricity. You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 6\nHow many days is the plant operational in Q4 2023?\nA. 72\nB. 73\nC. 74\nD. 75\nE. 76\nF. 77\nG. 78\nH. 79\nI. 80",

Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 6\nHow many days is the plant operational in Q4 2023?\nA. 72\nB. 73\nC. 74\nD. 75\nE. 76\nF. 77\nG. 78\nH. 79\nI. 80"

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 7\nHow many MWh of electricity are produced in total over the ten years?\nA. 728,047\nB. 728,048\nC. 728,049\nD. 728,050\nE. 728,051\nF. 728,052\nG. 728,053\nH. 728,054\nI. 728,055",

Instead, include installation instructions in the Markdown section of the response so that the user can perform the installation themselves.\n\n## Exploring data\n\nHere are some recommended ways of getting started with unfamiliar data.\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# 1. View the first few rows to get a sense of the data.\nhead(df)\n\n# 2. Get a quick overview of column types, names, and sample values.\nglimpse(df)\n\n# 3. Summary statistics for each column.\nsummary(df)\n\n# 4. Count how many distinct values each column has (useful for categorical variables).\ndf %>% summarise(across(everything(), n_distinct))\n\n# 5. Check for missing values in each column.\ndf %>% summarise(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.))))\n\n# 6. Quick frequency checks for categorical variables.\ndf %>% count(categorical_column_name)\n\n# 7. Basic distribution checks for numeric columns (histograms).\ndf %>%\n  mutate(bin = cut(numeric_column_name,\n                   breaks = seq(min(numeric_column_name, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                max(numeric_column_name, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                by = 10))) %>%\n  count(bin) %>%\n  arrange(bin)\n```\n\n## Showing data frames\n\nWhile using `run_r_code`, to look at a data frame (e.g. `df`), instead of `print(df)` or `kable(df)`, just do `df` which will result in the optimal display of the data frame.\n\n## Missing data\n\n* Watch carefully for missing values; when \"NA\" values appear, be curious about where they came from, and be sure to call the user's attention to them.\n* Be proactive about detecting missing values by using `is.na` liberally at the beginning of an analysis.\n* One helpful strategy to determine where NAs come from, is to look for correlations between missing values and values of other columns in the same data frame.\n* Another helpful strategy is to simply inspect sample rows that contain missing data and look for suspicious patterns.\n\n## Creating reports\n\nThe user may ask you to create a reproducible port. This will take the form of a Quarto document.\n\n1. First, make sure you know how to load all of the data that you plan to use for the analysis. If your analysis depends on data that was loaded by the user into the R session, not by your code, you must ask the user to tell you how the report should load that data.\n2. Second, respond to the user with a proposed report outline so they have a chance to review and edit it.\n3. Once an outline is agreed upon, create the report by calling the `create_quarto_report` tool.\n\nWhen calling the tool, be sure to follow these instructions:\n\n* The R code you include in the report must be ready to execute in a fresh R session. In particular, this means you need to know how to load whatever data you need. If you don't know, ask!\n* Assume that the user would like code chunks to be shown by default.\n* When possible, data-derived numbers that appear in the Markdown sections of Quarto documents should be written as `r` expressions (e.g., `r mean(x)`) rather than hard-coded, for reproducibility.\n* As you prepare to call the tool, tell the user that it might take a while.\n* Always include the following disclaimer in a callout at the top of the report (not including the code fence):\n```\n::: {.callout-note}\nThis report was generated using artificial intelligence (Claude from Anthropic) under general human direction. At the time of generation, the contents have not been comprehensively reviewed by a human analyst.\n\n<!--\nTo indicate human review: Delete the line above about contents not being reviewed, and replace this comment with:\nThe contents have been reviewed and validated by [Your Name], [Your Role] on [Date].\n-->\n:::\n```\n\n## Showing prompt suggestions\n\nIf you find it appropriate to suggest prompts the user might want to write, wrap the text of each prompt in <span class=\"suggestion\"> tags. Also use \"Suggested next steps:\" to introduce the suggestions. For example:\n\n```\nSuggested next steps:\n\n1. <span class=\"suggestion\">Investigate whether other columns in the same data frame exhibit the same pattern.<\/span>\n2. <span class=\"suggestion\">Inspect a few sample rows to see if there might be a clue as to the source of the anomaly.<\/span>\n3. <span class=\"suggestion\">Create a new data frame with all affected rows removed.<\/span>\n```",

It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \\nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \\nfloor price. \\nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \\nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \\nin that quarter. \\nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \\ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \\nthe other supplier. \\nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \\n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \\n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\\nFIXED COSTS \\nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \\nVALUATION \\nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \\nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \\nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \\ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\\n \\nGENERAL COMMENTS \\nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \\nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \\n \\nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \\nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \\n \\nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \\nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 7\\nHow many MWh of electricity are produced in total over the ten years?\\nA. 728,047\\nB. 728,048\\nC. 728,049\\nD. 728,050\\nE. 728,051\\nF. 728,052\\nG. 728,053\\nH. 728,054\\nI. 728,055\")\n***\n[Submission]: Based on my calculations:\n\n1.

The plant produces 205.2 MWh per day when operating (9MW * 95% * 24 hours)\n2.

The total production over the 10 years comes to 728,049.6 MWh\n\nLooking at the multiple choice options provided, the answer must be:\n\nC. 728,049\n\nThis is the correct answer because:\n1. The calculated value is 728,049.6 MWh\n2. When rounding to the nearest whole number, this becomes 728,049\n3. This matches exactly with option C\n***\n[Criterion]: D\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",

However, the correct answer according to the criterion is D (728,050).\n\nWhile the submission's methodology appears sound:\n1. Correctly calculating daily production (9MW * 95% * 24 hours = 205.2 MWh/day)\n2. Accounting for all shutdown periods\n3. Carrying out calculations over the 10-year period\n\nThe final answer they chose (728,049) is incorrect when compared to the criterion value of 728,050. The difference is small (just 0.4 MWh over the entire period), but in multiple choice questions, precision is crucial. \n\nSince the submission selected C (728,049) instead of the criterion answer D (728,050), this is an incorrect response.\n\nGRADE: I",

You must answer the question.You're situated inside of a directory with access to all of the files you should need to complete the task. Do not explore files outside of the directory. You're working autonomously; do not end your turn until you have a final result. There is no end user to respond to questions you may have.INTRODUCTION\nAll the inputs mentioned below are provided in the workbook for this case study. \nYou are working for a company that is planning to bid for a 20% stake in the cashflows of a biomass plant \nwhich burns wood chip to produce electricity. You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 7\nHow many MWh of electricity are produced in total over the ten years?\nA. 728,047\nB. 728,048\nC. 728,049\nD. 728,050\nE. 728,051\nF. 728,052\nG. 728,053\nH. 728,054\nI. 728,055"

You must answer the question.You're situated inside of a directory with access to all of the files you should need to complete the task. Do not explore files outside of the directory. You're working autonomously; do not end your turn until you have a final result. There is no end user to respond to questions you may have.INTRODUCTION\nAll the inputs mentioned below are provided in the workbook for this case study. \nYou are working for a company that is planning to bid for a 20% stake in the cashflows of a biomass plant \nwhich burns wood chip to produce electricity. You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 7\nHow many MWh of electricity are produced in total over the ten years?\nA. 728,047\nB. 728,048\nC. 728,049\nD. 728,050\nE. 728,051\nF. 728,052\nG. 728,053\nH. 728,054\nI. 728,055",

You must answer the question.You're situated inside of a directory with access to all of the files you should need to complete the task. Do not explore files outside of the directory. You're working autonomously; do not end your turn until you have a final result. There is no end user to respond to questions you may have.INTRODUCTION\nAll the inputs mentioned below are provided in the workbook for this case study. \nYou are working for a company that is planning to bid for a 20% stake in the cashflows of a biomass plant \nwhich burns wood chip to produce electricity. You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 7\nHow many MWh of electricity are produced in total over the ten years?\nA. 728,047\nB. 728,048\nC. 728,049\nD. 728,050\nE. 728,051\nF. 728,052\nG. 728,053\nH. 728,054\nI. 728,055"

You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 8\nWhat is the cap price in April 2025?\nA. $81.94\nB. $81.95\nC. $81.96\nD. $81.97\nE. $81.98\nF. $81.99\nG. $82.00\nH. $82.01\nI. $82.02",

Instead, include installation instructions in the Markdown section of the response so that the user can perform the installation themselves.\n\n## Exploring data\n\nHere are some recommended ways of getting started with unfamiliar data.\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# 1. View the first few rows to get a sense of the data.\nhead(df)\n\n# 2. Get a quick overview of column types, names, and sample values.\nglimpse(df)\n\n# 3. Summary statistics for each column.\nsummary(df)\n\n# 4. Count how many distinct values each column has (useful for categorical variables).\ndf %>% summarise(across(everything(), n_distinct))\n\n# 5. Check for missing values in each column.\ndf %>% summarise(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.))))\n\n# 6. Quick frequency checks for categorical variables.\ndf %>% count(categorical_column_name)\n\n# 7. Basic distribution checks for numeric columns (histograms).\ndf %>%\n  mutate(bin = cut(numeric_column_name,\n                   breaks = seq(min(numeric_column_name, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                max(numeric_column_name, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                by = 10))) %>%\n  count(bin) %>%\n  arrange(bin)\n```\n\n## Showing data frames\n\nWhile using `run_r_code`, to look at a data frame (e.g. `df`), instead of `print(df)` or `kable(df)`, just do `df` which will result in the optimal display of the data frame.\n\n## Missing data\n\n* Watch carefully for missing values; when \"NA\" values appear, be curious about where they came from, and be sure to call the user's attention to them.\n* Be proactive about detecting missing values by using `is.na` liberally at the beginning of an analysis.\n* One helpful strategy to determine where NAs come from, is to look for correlations between missing values and values of other columns in the same data frame.\n* Another helpful strategy is to simply inspect sample rows that contain missing data and look for suspicious patterns.\n\n## Creating reports\n\nThe user may ask you to create a reproducible port. This will take the form of a Quarto document.\n\n1. First, make sure you know how to load all of the data that you plan to use for the analysis. If your analysis depends on data that was loaded by the user into the R session, not by your code, you must ask the user to tell you how the report should load that data.\n2. Second, respond to the user with a proposed report outline so they have a chance to review and edit it.\n3. Once an outline is agreed upon, create the report by calling the `create_quarto_report` tool.\n\nWhen calling the tool, be sure to follow these instructions:\n\n* The R code you include in the report must be ready to execute in a fresh R session. In particular, this means you need to know how to load whatever data you need. If you don't know, ask!\n* Assume that the user would like code chunks to be shown by default.\n* When possible, data-derived numbers that appear in the Markdown sections of Quarto documents should be written as `r` expressions (e.g., `r mean(x)`) rather than hard-coded, for reproducibility.\n* As you prepare to call the tool, tell the user that it might take a while.\n* Always include the following disclaimer in a callout at the top of the report (not including the code fence):\n```\n::: {.callout-note}\nThis report was generated using artificial intelligence (Claude from Anthropic) under general human direction. At the time of generation, the contents have not been comprehensively reviewed by a human analyst.\n\n<!--\nTo indicate human review: Delete the line above about contents not being reviewed, and replace this comment with:\nThe contents have been reviewed and validated by [Your Name], [Your Role] on [Date].\n-->\n:::\n```\n\n## Showing prompt suggestions\n\nIf you find it appropriate to suggest prompts the user might want to write, wrap the text of each prompt in <span class=\"suggestion\"> tags. Also use \"Suggested next steps:\" to introduce the suggestions. For example:\n\n```\nSuggested next steps:\n\n1. <span class=\"suggestion\">Investigate whether other columns in the same data frame exhibit the same pattern.<\/span>\n2. <span class=\"suggestion\">Inspect a few sample rows to see if there might be a clue as to the source of the anomaly.<\/span>\n3. <span class=\"suggestion\">Create a new data frame with all affected rows removed.<\/span>\n```",

The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \\ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \\nthe other supplier. \\nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \\n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \\n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\\nFIXED COSTS \\nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month.

You must answer the question.You're situated inside of a directory with access to all of the files you should need to complete the task. Do not explore files outside of the directory. You're working autonomously; do not end your turn until you have a final result. There is no end user to respond to questions you may have.INTRODUCTION\nAll the inputs mentioned below are provided in the workbook for this case study. \nYou are working for a company that is planning to bid for a 20% stake in the cashflows of a biomass plant \nwhich burns wood chip to produce electricity. You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 8\nWhat is the cap price in April 2025?\nA. $81.94\nB. $81.95\nC. $81.96\nD. $81.97\nE. $81.98\nF. $81.99\nG. $82.00\nH. $82.01\nI. $82.02",

You're working autonomously; do not end your turn until you have a final result. There is no end user to respond to questions you may have.INTRODUCTION\nAll the inputs mentioned below are provided in the workbook for this case study. \nYou are working for a company that is planning to bid for a 20% stake in the cashflows of a biomass plant \nwhich burns wood chip to produce electricity. You have been asked to predict the cashflows of the project \nfrom 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026, using a quarterly model, and to use your model to \nrecommend to your CEO the purchase price she should offer for the 20% stake. \nYou should assume that all invoices are settled in the same quarter they are issued, there are no \ninventory requirements and no taxes are applicable. \nWhere amounts are to be inflated they are given in 2017 prices and inflation should be applied on 1 \nJanuary of each subsequent year.  Do NOT round inflated prices to whole cents in interim calculations. \nELECTRICITY GENERATION \nThe plant is a 9MW plant; i.e. if it is running at full capacity it will produce 9MWh of electricity per hour. \nYour company’s engineers think it is reasonable to assume that the plant will usually run at 95% of its \ncapacity, 24 hours a day. \nThere are several planned shutdown periods when no electricity will be produced at all from the start of \nthe first day (at midnight) until the end of the final day (at midnight). \n\nFirst day of shutdown     Final day of shutdown\n1 June 2017               15 June 2017\n15 December 2019          3 January 2020\n5 April 2021              25 April 2021\n25 October 2023           10 November 2023\n6 May 2025                26 May 2025\n26 June 2026              5 July 2026\n\n\nSALE OF ELECTRICITY \nElectricity is sold as follows: \n• At the market price if this is between the cap price and the floor price.\nThe predictions for the market price have been provided in the workbook accompanying this \nquestion on an April -March annual timeline, and should not be inflated. \n• At the cap price if the market price is higher than the cap price.\nThe cap price is $70 per MWh, inflated at 2% per annum. \n• At the floor price if the market price is lower than the floor price.\nThe floor price is $45 per MWh, inflated at 1% per annum.\n \nYour CEO is concerned that the market price predictions for the sale of electricity may be overly optimistic.  \nShe has therefore asked you to run some of the analysis (see Questions 5, 11 and 13) as though \nelectricity were always sold at the floor price.  It will be beneficial if you develop your model in a way that \nmakes it easy to switch between modelling the electricity price as described above and modelling only the \nfloor price. \nPURCHASE OF WOOD CHIP \nIn each quarter, the project purchases exactly enough wood chip to produce the MWh output of the plant \nin that quarter. \nThe plant has two possible wood chip suppliers. The project first buys the wood chip from the supplier that \ngives them the lowest cost per MWh in that quarter, and, if necessary, tops this up with wood chip from \nthe other supplier. \nThe first supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $100 per tonne, inflated at 2% per annum\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 3.5 MWh of electricity\n• Up to 4,500 tonnes may be purchased per quarter\nThe second supplier sells wood chip on the following terms: \n• Wood chip costs $130 per tonne. This is a fixed price that should not be inflated\n• 1 tonne of wood chip will produce 4 MWh of electricity\n• An unlimited amount of wood chip may be purchased per quarter\nFIXED COSTS \nThe project incurs $75,000 of fixed costs per month. This amount is indexed at 1.5%. \nVALUATION \nThe company’s required rate of return for this project is 10%, and you should assume that there is no \nterminal value or disposal costs for the 20% stake at the end of the ten years. \nTo determine the purchase price your company should offer: \ni) Discount using an Excel function (or functions) that discounts on an actual/365 basis;\nii) Assume an acquisition date of 31 December 2016; and\niii) Assume that all cashflows occur at the end of the quarter in which they occur.\n \nGENERAL COMMENTS \nWhen used in the question wording, “Q1” refers to the period January to March, “Q2” to the period April to \nJune, “Q3” to the period July to September and “Q4” to the period October to December. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 17, perform your analysis assuming a 10% required rate of return. \nFor Question 18, perform your analysis assuming a 4% required rate of return. \n \nFor Questions 6 to 16, select your answer from a multiple choice list. \nFor Questions 17 to 18, you are required to type in your answer.\n\n\nQuestion 8\nWhat is the cap price in April 2025?\nA. $81.94\nB. $81.95\nC. $81.96\nD. $81.97\nE. $81.98\nF. $81.99\nG. $82.00\nH. $82.01\nI. $82.02",
